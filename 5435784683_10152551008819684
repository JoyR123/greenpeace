I hope and pray they don't get shafted in the end. Yes we have a great need for clean energy, not nuclear, not oil, nor coal. Yes their are better options.

So many inventions, ideas put on the shelf, dusty awaiting for us. Many misinformed still think Edison invented AC power, or Marconi invented the radio. Oh the lies we have been taught. New ideas! No better ideas just sitting there waiting on us. Some time soon some one will pick up the gauntlet and throw it in in these companies face. New jobs will come running to us begging for our help.", "id": "10152551008819684_10152553933854684", "user_likes": false}]}}
