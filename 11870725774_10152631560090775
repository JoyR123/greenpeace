Political commentators and academics take us behind the scenes to show how politics in New Zealand really works.\n\nIncluding a wealth of archival material and interviews, this feature documentary is a thoughtful and provocative response to the question - is it possible for a small modern democratic nation to address the greatest political challenge of our age?\n\nHere are the screening times - \n\nDunedin\nFriday 8 August               1:00 p.m. RAILTO CINEMA\nSunday 10 August           1:15 p.m. RIALTO CINEMA\n\nChristchurch\nMonday 11 August          6:00 p.m. HOYTS NORTHLAND 3 CINEMA\nTuesday 12 August         11:00 a.m. HOYTS NORTHLAND 3 CINEMA\n\nNelson\nWednesday 20 August         6 p.m. SUTER GALLERY", "total": {"new": 1.3513513514, "months": {"1": 3, "3": 4, "2": 10, "5": 11, "4": 6, "7": 9, "6": 6, "8": 25}, "reeng": {"10": 67, "1": 1, "3": 2, "2": 1, "5": 1, "7": 1, "9": 1}, "month": 4.0540540541}, "type": "link", "id": "11870725774_10152631560090775", "description": "A new documentary by Alister Barry & Abi King-Jones"}
