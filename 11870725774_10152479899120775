These are some of the last images captured from the on-board webcam.\n\nPress Release follows:\n\nNorwegian coastguard boards Greenpeace ship in defiance of international maritime law\n\nBarents Sea, May 30th 2014 -- The Norwegian coastguard tonight boarded the Greenpeace ship Esperanza outside of the country\u2019s territorial waters to end a high profile and perfectly legal protest against Arctic oil drilling. The environmental group considers the boarding of the ship illegal under international maritime law.  \n\nAt 10:10PM CET the Norwegian Coastguard requested Esperanza to end its occupation of the Hoop drilling site and end an 89 hour protest. After the ship refused to leave its position 30 minutes later, an unknown number of Norwegian coast guard arriving in two boats boarded the ship at 10:50pm CET and immediately ended all communications from the ship.\n\n\"The Norwegian Coast Guard is stopping a legal and peaceful Greenpeace action against Arctic drilling. The Esperanza was exercising its right to freedom of navigation as guaranteed in international law. While inconvenient for Statoil, our actions were lawful, in contrast to the intervention by the Coastguard.\u201d said Greenpeace International legal counsel Daniel Simons.\n\nSpeaking from the deck of the Esperanza moments before it was boarded, Greenpeace Arctic campaigner Sune Scheller said:\n\n\u201cWe are appalled by Norway\u2019s decision to end a peaceful and legal protest. It keeps surprising me how far states will go to protect Big Oil. We have just as much right as Statoil to sail our ship in this part of the Arctic Ocean. We will not stand by while their drilling rigs destroy our last remaining wild places.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve achieved. Statoil has had to put its plans to drill the northernmost well in the world on hold since we began the protest 89 hours ago. Now we are apparently being taken by the authorities and our occupation ended. Now it\u2019s up to everyone to stand up against Statoil and all the other companies wanting to exploit the Arctic, instead of protect it.\u201d\n\nEarlier today Greenpeace lawyers insisted that the creation of a safety zone without due warning breaches both the international law of the sea and Norwegian maritime law. The full text of Greenpeace\u2019s appeal is available below.\n\nNorway\u2019s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) extends 200 miles from the country\u2019s coastline. Under Article 58, paragraph 1, of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, foreign vessels like the Esperanza enjoy freedom of navigation through the EEZ .\n\nEarlier this week a total of 15 Greenpeace activists occupied the Statoil contracted oil rig for 48 hours before climbers were removed by police and taken to the city of Troms\u00f8. All were released without charge. Hours later the Greenpeace ship Esperanza sailed towards the Hoop drilling site and occupied the area in an attempt to block the rig from moving into position.  \n\nEnds.", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"1": 40, "3": 22, "2": 31, "5": 76, "4": 27}, "reeng": {"10": 158, "3": 1, "2": 16, "5": 6, "4": 5, "7": 4, "6": 3, "9": 1, "8": 2}, "month": 20.4081632653}, "type": "photo", "id": "11870725774_10152479899120775", "petition": null, "comments": {"months": {"1": 3, "2": 2, "5": 4, "4": 5}, "reeng": {"10": 10, "3": 1, "2": 2, "7": 1}, "month": 21.4285714286, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTY=", "before": "MTY="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/11870725774_10152479899120775/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=MTY%3D"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 16, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "10153323786986972", "name": "Angela Janse van Rensburg"}, "like_count": 22, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-05-30T21:58:51+0000", "message": "Shame on the government of Norway.
