This time, the events that unfolded sent shockwaves across the world.\n\nWith the eyes of the world upon them, Russia charged the crew, from 18 different countries, with piracy and hooliganism in the most ruthless response from a national government against an NGO in a quarter of a century.\n\nTheir imprisonment, which saw worldwide media cast the Arctic 30 in the same mould as political prisoners like Pussy Riot and Mikhail Khodorkovsky, lasted months. However, their resolve to try and stop oil drilling in the Arctic was never broken.\n\nComplete with never-before-seen footage and behind-the-scenes access, \u2018Black Ice\u2019 tells the story of the Arctic 30 from the moment they set sail to protest at the controversial Prirazlomnaya oil platform, to their arrest, imprisonment\u2026 and what happened next.\n\nhttp://blackicemovie.net/\n\nFree entry!"}
