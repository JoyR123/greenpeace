Having windmills to generate electricity is also acceptable to us. But wherever it is required to dig land we should not stop ourselves.\nThe government has rightly thought of planting trees on the highways. Let\u2019s also increase our forests through more plantations of big trees on barren Government land by first diverting the rivers to these barren areas. Increase irrigation facilities. Connect rivers to make them always full with water. \nPlease do not adhere to these propagandists who just talk of Green Earth.
