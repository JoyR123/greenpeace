{"context": {"cc": "NZ", "lang": "EN", "nro": "NZD"}, "from": {"id": 11870725774}, "name": "After the protests at sea against the Brazilian oil giant Petrobras\u2019 deep sea drilling exploits off the East Cape were so successful, the National Government made certain aspects of protest at sea illegal with the Anadarko Amendment to clear the way for the Texan oil giant Anadarko to have a go.\n\nWe then showed how catastrophic a blowout could be at oilspillmap.org.nz and headed out to sea with the Oil Free Seas Flotilla to confront Anadarko\u2019s drillship for four days and nights at the deep sea drill-site West of Raglan. \n\nBut despite all the risks, and the obvious public opposition they drilled anyway (and found nothing).\n\nWe then asked you, our supporters, to help fund a High Court legal case to challenge the laws around deep sea drilling \u2026 and the response was an incredible $50,700 http://greenpe.ac/1v0vAfJ\n\nThat gave us the confidence and ability to go to court where we successfully showed that the laws around deep sea drilling are utterly inadequate. Even though Minister Simon Bridges had claimed Anadarko had been put \u201cthrough the wringer\u201d, the \u2018Environmental Protection Agency\u2019 (EPA) hadn\u2019t even considered it necessary to look at Anadarko\u2019s own risk assessment.\n\nBut the court could not stop the drilling and the judge awarded costs to the EPA and Anadarko because (according to this Government\u2019s law), the drilling was \u201clegal\u201d despite the cowboy approach to oversight. We are obliged to pay Anadarko $24,969 on top of other costs we incurred.\n\nSo before we make the payment, we\u2019ve sent Anadarko this letter asking them whether since they\u2019re an offshore company, would it be easier for them if we made the payment directly to the Cayman Islands, where they are registered? And also, we\u2019re just curious whether they might have set up this complex financial scheme in order to avoid liability in New Zealand, say in the case of a catastrophic oil spill like that of the Deepwater Horizon (which Anadarko was found jointly liable for by US Courts).\n\n\u2018Anadarko NZ Taranaki\u2019 is an overseas company whose country of origin is the Cayman Islands. It is registered at \u2018Ugland House\u2019, an address which is home to more than 12,000 companies, is linked to tax avoidance schemes, and which President Barack Obama called \u201ceither the biggest building in the world or the biggest tax scam in the world\u201d.\n\nAnd Simon Bridges expects us to trust them.
