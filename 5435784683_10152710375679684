Fires are  natural in much of the southeastern United States.  Many systems are actually fire dependent.  I do believe that climate issues are real but I think this should be put into context and have more supporting data.  This type of post can do both harm and good.  I'm concerned this gives fire a bad reputation and can impact the already poor understanding of the need for prescribed burns and wildfires in the southeast. Not to mention that most wildfires in the west have a human origin.  There are multiple factors at play, and sure, climate is exacerbating fires, but this seems a tad too dramatic and seeking to induce fear. Arguably, that's one strategy for getting individuals to be concerned about climate change, but fear often blocks understanding of the actual issue.", "id": "10152710375679684_10152711318884684", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2014, 9, 3, 0], "full_picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQB0Tr8EIobU4kEx&url=http%3A%2F%2Fupw-prod-images.global.ssl.fastly.net%2Fnugget%2F540089b82627899c79000034%2F540089b82627899c79000034-d0cda44f0af0263d32155013e27e47a5.png", "caption": "upworthy.com", "edge": "posts", "link": "http://www.upworthy.com/its-not-the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it-but-watching-this-made-that-song-come-to-mind?c=gp1", "shares": {"count": 163}, "urls": [], "created_time": "2014-09-03T00:00:00+0000", "message": "There are 45,000 wildfires per year in the southeastern U.S. alone, and since 2000, we've had eight of the worst years for wildfires.
