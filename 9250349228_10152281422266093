This is the same plan that many in society now oppose because they are told it is what contributes to higher energy prices (quite far from the truth). People are lazy, selfish, apathetic and only care about cost. Understandable to an extent, but too many still convince themselves that global warming and environmental issues are 'someone elses problem'. Second, China, while its true that China pumps out enormous volumes of filth, they are also the first to suffer from such output - mainly in the form of super nasty smog, health issues and a general impact on environmental wellbeing. I know first hand that attitudes are slowly changing and more and more industries are actively trying to reduce dependency on dirty grid electricity. So while there is still a long way to go, there is rising motivation in China to reduce emissions. One of the biggest reasons they need so much power is their sheer industrial scale. We can whine about that all day, but the fact is most of our low western prices of things we consider vital to our standard of living is only financially viable due to Chinese industry. One hand feeds the other. This is a global problem and every single individual has a responsibility to live cleaner, more efficient and reduce our impact. If you think the climate is getting wacky already, give it 20 years.
