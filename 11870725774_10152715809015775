EVERY FREAKING MONTH and I am outraged that this Facebook page has not mentioned ONCE That Avaaz is mobilizing the world first People's Climate March ALL AROUND THE WORLD\u2026.on the 21st of September (NEXT FREAKING SUNDAY) And we the people of Auckland are marching on Sunday 21st September from the bottom of Britomart at 1.pm up to Aotea Square. This march along with thousands of other marches all around the world is to provide proof and film footage for Avaaz to show the delegates of the UNs Climate Summit Meeting in NYC later this month, that the people of the world are seriously concerned about the cataclysmic reality of Global Warming. Avaaz have 15 minutes time allocated to address the delegates of the summit.The People's Climate March AKL have asked Auckland's Greenpeace for help and all you have said is that you don't think the march is a good idea the day after the general election!!! WTF??? There is more going on in the world than New Zealand's general election\u2026 Avaaz with 38 million supporters \u2026 virtually never ask for money\u2026unlike Greenpeace who are ALWAYS asking my husband and I for MORE money, and as a monthly donator to Greenpeace Why have you not told me and my husband about the march\u2026 not in an email and not on Greenpeace's Facebook page? What are we financially paying you guys for? This is a rhetorical question I am so hurt and angry by Greenpeace Auckland\u2026 I know you are wonderfully super busy with the Climate Vote\u2026 YES of course my husband have signed the Climate Vote petition but WHY HAVE YOU NOT 'advertised' mentioned or publicly supported Avaaz People's Climate march? Why are these events mutually exclusive surely they are mutually compatible even if the march IS the day after the election or ESPECIALLY because it's the day after?", "id": "10152715809015775_10152717700395775", "user_likes": false}]}, "pid": 11870725774, "object_id": "828339260517622", "datetime": [2014, 9, 12, 0], "full_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xat1/t31.0-8/c504.0.592.592/10700716_1467167130222565_4548608696198750216_o.jpg", "caption": "The Climax Concert: maximising action on climate change", "edge": "posts", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/events/828339260517622/", "shares": {"count": 1}, "urls": [{"components": {"fragment": "", "netloc": "climaxconcert.eventbrite.co.nz", "params": "", "query": {}, "path": [""], "scheme": "http"}, "url": "http://www.climaxconcert.eventbrite.co.nz", "driver": null, "ea": {"ea.campaign.id": null, "ea.client.id": null}, "redir": {"service": null, "url": "http://www.climaxconcert.eventbrite.co.nz", "surl": null, "key": "f4871d744d3bc89733f485ee52ce2cf3", "aurora": false, "history": []}, "landing": "http://www.climaxconcert.eventbrite.co.nz", "key": "f4871d744d3bc89733f485ee52ce2cf3", "petition": null}], "created_time": "2014-09-12T00:22:42+0000", "message": "Looking for some climate fun this weekend?
