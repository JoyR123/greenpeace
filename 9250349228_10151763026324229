Let me introduce the Wollemi Pine, the dinosaur tree.\n\nDuring the Cretaceous period which ended around 66 million years ago, the Araucariaceae family of coniferous trees were very common. Fossils of the Araucariaceae were found dating back even further to the Jurassic period 200 million years ago. One of the species in this family is wollemia which was thought to be long extinct.\n\nUntil...\n\nIn 1994 David Noble, a field officer at Wollemi National Park in Australia\u2019s Blue Mountains, spotted an unusual tree and decided to investigate. It turned out this tree was entirely new to science and nothing like any other living tree, its closest match was a fossilised tree from several million years ago.\n\nThe Wollemi Pine, named wollemia nobilis after David Noble, is the last living example of the Wollemia genus. There are now only around 100 wild specimens left and their exact location is a closely guarded secret. You can, however, see specimens in places like Kew Gardens in London.\n\nEvery year scientists (and the occasional national park ranger) find new species of plants and animals in the world\u2019s forests, yet they are being cut down at a faster rate than ever before.\n\nBut together we can stand up to protect forests and the incredible diversity of life they contain.
