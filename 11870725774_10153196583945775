Are you listening Simon Bridges MP? Are you listening Statoil?\"\n\nWe were humbled by the number of people who joined us, and we were inspired by the positive energy you brought with you.\n\nTahi rua toru wh\u0101, waho papa moana!\n\nGood on you Auckland!", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"11": 24, "10": 29, "12": 147, "1": 80, "3": 52, "2": 69, "5": 27, "4": 36, "7": 25, "6": 37, "9": 22, "8": 34}, "reeng": {"10": 400, "3": 13, "2": 77, "5": 16, "4": 25, "7": 10, "6": 19, "9": 12, "8": 10}, "month": 13.7457044674}, "id": "11870725774_10153196583945775", "cloud": null, "comments": {"months": {"11": 1, "10": 2, "12": 5, "1": 9, "3": 2, "2": 5, "5": 1, "4": 1, "7": 1, "6": 5, "9": 1, "8": 5}, "reeng": {"10": 23, "3": 2, "2": 9, "4": 2, "6": 2}, "month": 23.6842105263, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "Mzg=", "before": "Mzg="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/11870725774_10153196583945775/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=Mzg%3D"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 38, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "10153213167419743", "name": "Christina Robinson"}, "like_count": 8, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2015-04-02T06:03:15+0000", "message": "Really was an awesome atmosphere people coming together to care for our precious oceans, we live on an island and we are the last frontier to the Antarctic, will they go there Next?", "id": "10153196583945775_10153196979490775", "user_likes": false}]}, "from": {"category": "Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)", "name": "Greenpeace New Zealand", "category_list": [{"id": "152880021441864", "name": "Community Organization"}, {"id": "191523214199822", "name": "Environmental Conservation"}], "id": "11870725774"}, "object_id": "10153196583945775", "type": "video", "petition": null, "context": {"cc": "NZ", "lang": "EN", "nro": "NZD"}, "full_picture": "https://fbcdn-vthumb-a.akamaihd.net/hvthumb-ak-xfa1/v/t15.0-10/s720x720/11114457_10153196613300775_1184667630_n.jpg?oh=68b17e38e4442a6b47fb621724f9456b&oe=56347C8D&__gda__=1445871581_4462c9b1900f649def3bd43d6a67f39a", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/greenpeace.nz/videos/10153196583945775/", "name": "March Against Deep Sea Oil", "edge": "posts", "urls": [], "basket": {"capture": "message", "name": "climate"}, "likes": {"months": {"11": 23, "10": 28, "12": 145, "1": 77, "3": 52, "2": 67, "5": 26, "4": 36, "7": 24, "6": 36, "9": 21, "8": 31}, "reeng": {"10": 389, "3": 13, "2": 74, "5": 16, "4": 23, "7": 10, "6": 19, "9": 12, "8": 10}, "month": 13.6042402827, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxNTMzNjM1Nzk2NzExNTU=", "before": "MTAxNTMzNjM1Nzk2NzExNTU="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/11870725774_10153196583945775/likes?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=MTAxNTMzNjM1Nzk2NzExNTU%3D"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 572}, "data": [{"id": "10153363579671155", "name": "Alan William Preston"}]}}
