Thank you for posting. It has informed and inspired me further :-) \n\nCan we do something Kumi Naidoo asks us to do at the very end of the speech??? Can we work together with other organisations and campaigns? Campaigns which have a common aim of promoting peace, stopping murder and protecting animals and the planet and our future? \n\nCan Greenpeace please lend their voice to join London Against the dolphin massacres Taiji Japan??? And support this campaign? It doesn't matter whose campaign it is. What matters is the dolphins. Joint efforts are more powerful ... You may have connections in the media or with celebrities that could increase awareness of this terrible practise ... \n\nIf we don't act now, many dolphins will be captured for human entertainment / slaughtered for dog meat or human consumption in Taiji Japan. Their people don't know it's dolphin meat or about mercury poisoning. Some are trapped in the bay RIGHT NOW waiting to be killed. Many are young . \n\nI appeal to Greenpeace to JOIN the protest and try to save these dolphins from brutal death / life of captivity, and make this world a better place. Please don't stand by and do nothing \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1545547719014679/", "id": "10152110246424229_10152114066819229", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2014, 11, 2, 14], "full_picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCya8bs7cfmP2QY&w=720&h=720&url=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FJawwkFA2dGU%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&cfs=1", "caption": "youtube.com", "edge": "posts", "link": "http://youtu.be/JawwkFA2dGU", "shares": {"count": 23}, "urls": [{"components": {"fragment": "", "netloc": "secure.greenpeace.org.uk", "params": "", "query": {"source": "fb", "utm_medium": "fb", "subsource": "20141031jtmvtfb02", "utm_source": "gpeace", "utm_campaign": "20141031jtmvtfb02"}, "path": ["page", "s", "join-the-movement-now"], "scheme": "https"}, "url": "http://bit.ly/1pbaOez", "driver": null, "ea": {"ea.campaign.id": null, "ea.client.id": null}, "redir": {"service": "bit.ly", "url": "https://secure.greenpeace.org.uk/page/s/join-the-movement-now?source=fb&subsource=20141031jtmvtfb02&utm_source=gpeace&utm_medium=fb&utm_campaign=20141031jtmvtfb02", "surl": "1pbaOez", "key": "ce0849defc859653492ce1569b06b10e", "aurora": false, "history": ["http://bit.ly/1pbaOez"]}, "landing": "https://secure.greenpeace.org.uk/page/s/join-the-movement-now?source=fb&subsource=20141031jtmvtfb02&utm_source=gpeace&utm_medium=fb&utm_campaign=20141031jtmvtfb02", "key": "ce0849defc859653492ce1569b06b10e", "petition": null}], "created_time": "2014-11-02T14:15:00+0000", "message": "Inspiring words from Kumi Naidoo, head of Greenpeace International.\n\nGet involved with the Greenpeace movement here >> http://bit.ly/1pbaOez", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"11": 33, "10": 4, "1": 1, "3": 17, "2": 28, "5": 5, "4": 11, "7": 10, "6": 11, "9": 7, "8": 6}, "reeng": {"8": 1, "3": 4, "4": 2, "10": 126}, "month": 0.7518796992}, "type": "video", "id": "9250349228_10152110246424229", "description": "Kumi Naidoo (Executive Director, Greenpeace International) delivered this moving and remarkably inspirational closing plenary at the Resource Alliance's Inte..."}
