The focus of the attention is on Norwegian oil giant, Statoil who plan to begin seismic testing off the west coast of Northland in December over 10,000 square kilometres of deep sea bed.\n\nThere are fears for the wellbeing of a multitude of sea life including whales, dolphins and fish of all types.\n\nPeople drew together from around Northland and a busload had travelled a serious distance to show support from Te Whanau-a-Apanui near East Cape, who, although a small tribe, had been central to defeating Brazilian oil giant Petrobras in recent years.\n\nAt night, kaumatua Uncle Bundy Waitai of the most northern tribe Ngati Kuri, explained the incredible history of early waka migration that wove together the tribal links of people from the east coast and the top of the north. \n\nMartin Norman from Greenpeace in Norway explained that the people of Norway have no idea their biggest company Statoil is in this country and causing strife.\n\nDayle Takitumu of Te Whanau a Apanui who has been one of the most prominent spokespeople in their fight again Petrobras gave an inspiring talk about the spectrum of strategies used to repel Petrobras. Then everybody slipped into the world of sleep amidst a symphony of snoring.\n\nJoin us as we travel south towards the Oil Conference. Hopefully you can join us opposite Britomart between 11.30-12 noon then we head to the Oil Conference at Sky City.
