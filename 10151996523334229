I really think Greenpeace shld be campaigning against the TTIP asap as it cld have disastrous consequences for our ability to protect the environment!! TTIP is a 'trade' deal btw EU & US being negotiated in secret atm which wld privatise the NHS & other public bodies, & give corporations the power to sue sovereign govts for loss of profits resulting from public policy decisions -in secret courts! Ie a democratically-elected govt cld be held to ransom by a multinational for passing any law that impinges on said multinational's profits, e.g. laws to protect the environment e.g. laws to prevent use of toxic chemicals -not to mention workers' rights (e.g. minimum wage & safety standards), consumers' rights (e.g. food safety rules, incl use of GMOs! caps on energy companies), citizens' rights (e.g. data protection laws & new banking safety rules), the list goes on & on. Use yr imagination for application to the environment!!\u2026toxic emissions, use of dirty fuels, protection of national parks from fracking or anywhere from fracking! Protection of rivers/streams/oceans from emissions or over-fishing. Incl animal rights\u2026anything, in short which cld damage a corporation's profits! And this is multinationals from all over the world -particularly US. They're trying to deregulate everything & make it all like the US & worse -corporations running everything, incl NHS & education! Profit put before all else. No ability to renationalise anything once made private. The end of democracy! 38 Degrees is organising a Day of Action tomorrow Sat 30th (see their page for details & a petition) & others are also organising petitions e.g. Sumofus.org.
