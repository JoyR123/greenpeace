CO2, GMO food and Nuclear Arms are bigger disasters that we tend to overlook.\n\nYou have to understand that NO ONE till date has DIED in that disaster. That disaster was caused because of the Tsunami and not because of the way it was built. Please get your facts right before your outright start blaming a technology you don't fully understand. Nuclear Energy is similar to Petrol - Put Petrol in a Car and it will help you drive. Put Petrol in a bottle and people will use it as a bomb. We need to focus our efforts on banning Nuclear Weapons instead of Nuclear Energy. We need that energy if we wish to continue as a civilised race.\n\nBut do you know how many have died in Oil Spills? How many continue to face health problems due to CarbonDioxide?\nHere's a research paper that shows the effects of Carbondioxide in the atmosphere on our ecosystem and particularly on human beings.\n - http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/proceedings/04/carbon-seq/169.pdf", "id": "795126377189704", "user_likes": false}, {"from": {"id": "10152756015405124", "name": "Krishna Kanth"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2015-01-19T07:36:34+0000", "message": "Thats exactly our point . Disasters can happen every where..they can happen with the nuclear plants as well. We can afford other diasters whose effect is short term. But we cannot afford a nuclear disaster which is extremely long term. Well no. of deaths is not the only measure of damage. More people die of slipping in bathrooms than due to radio activity. That does not mean radio activity is safer. I firmly reject the GMO food and see it as one of the greatest threats to humanity. The problems associated with CO2 emissions can be reversed with policy changes and strict enforcement and by switching to renewable energy. There can be measures taken after those disasters and people can get back with their work as usual on a daily basis. This is not the case with nuclear disasters. The damage due to nuclear disasters is irreversible and extremely long lasting (have to wait for 100s or 1000s of years to reach normalcy). The probability of occurring might be .0001, but once it occurs there is absolutely nothing that you can do.
