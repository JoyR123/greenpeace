It is true that not so long ago parliament said it was breaking up early as there was nothing else to do for the summer.... and yet now fracking is making headlines in the silly season....when nothing serious is supposed to be going on.....this country is sleep-walking into catastrophe. The idea that final decisions are to be left in the hands of Eric Pickles is frankly abhorrent, the man is without moral  integrity.  There has without doubt been a conspiracy of governmental policies to bring fracking rapidly into reality....with little chance of proper opposition. Cameron has been a ruthless and shameless hypocrite. The global ransacking of shale gas now taking place is the final insult on this already damaged and struggling planet. It feels unstoppable.", "id": "10151935369619229_10151935372304229", "user_likes": false}]}}
