Sometimes it\u2019s fishing over quota (catching more than you should, or species that you shouldn\u2019t), sometimes it\u2019s fishing in ways or places you shouldn\u2019t. Overfishing may seem like a victimless crime \u2013 but it isn\u2019t, and the ultimate effect is bad news for our oceans, the creatures that live in them, and the humans whose livelihoods or future food source depends on them.\r\n\r\nThe effective regulation of our oceans is truly a global problem, made worse by the fact that so many destructive methods and levels of overfishing are perfectly legal in so many places.\r\n\r\nIt stands to reason then perhaps that the very least we should expect of national governments is to try and make sure that those fishing in their waters play by the rules, and stick to the law.
