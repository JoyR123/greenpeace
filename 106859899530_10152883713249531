Meet Fernando, the first mate on the Rainbow Warrior hailing from Galicia, Spain but with roots in both Madrid and Palma D'Majorca.\n   Fernando nurtured a childhood dream of being a captain, he studied in Maritime School and worked on various kinds of merchant ships, but in his heart he was always a sailor with a deep inborn desire to chase the wind.\n It was in 1995 when he was on a supertanker when he saw Environmental crimes being committed which strengthened his resolve to make a difference. Soon he joined Greenpeace Spain as a member and spent some time on the Zorba , a boat owned by Greenpeace Spain. \n  Eventually destiny paved his way to the Arctic Sunrise in 2007, where he met Captain Daniel Rizotti, a man he deeply admires. Ask him about his most exciting action and his eyes light up with an old memory of the Rainbow Warrior II in Denmark where the captain pulled off a daring (and tricky) double anchor manouver just 5 meters from a coal carrying ship. Effectively blocking its way for 3 days. \" I didn't really think it was possible\" he says, ,\"but he did it so well, it was amazing,\"\n  Below is a photo of Fernando on the bow of the Rainbow Warrior, taking a sight of the sun with a Sextant in order to determine the position of the ship.", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"11": 8, "10": 11, "12": 28, "1": 27, "3": 20, "2": 32, "5": 16, "4": 12, "7": 11, "6": 11, "9": 22, "8": 21}, "reeng": {"10": 153, "3": 6, "2": 21, "5": 6, "4": 9, "7": 6, "6": 8, "9": 5, "8": 5}, "month": 12.3287671233}, "type": "photo", "id": "106859899530_10152883713249531", "petition": null, "comments": {"months": {"9": 1, "8": 1, "4": 1, "7": 1}, "reeng": {"10": 4}, "month": 0.0, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "NA==", "before": "NA=="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/106859899530_10152883713249531/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=883483195046454|9nfpAUxoDRMZ77lLiQ83CrnaV3s&after=NA%3D%3D"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 4, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "10153282726967065", "name": "Chitri"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2015-03-26T21:52:30+0000", "message": "Yeah!
