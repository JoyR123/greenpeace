Should the extensive damage or destruction of our environment be recognized as criminal, as ecocide? That question has been debated at international legal forums, and at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2012. The United Nations has committed to investigate this concern.   \nAs a result of the UN Env Programme report that we are not on a sustainable path 7 Supreme Court judges, the US EPA Chief council and Canada's Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development were brought together under the UN Environmental Programme to assess how environmental laws can be improved to ensure our survival.  What threat does the mismanagement and or plundering of fish, forest, water, soil resources, to species, to ocean and terrestrial ecosystems, to our planet's climate pose to our future?  Has the Harper Conservatives acted with due diligence to the threats of global climate destabilisation? Despite repeated correspondence to PM Stephen Harper about ecocide, he has not responded to my concerns, worse I have been informed by his correspondence department that they have no evidence of my correspondence. Is someone tampering with correspondence from Canadians to PM Stephen Harper? To find out more about prosecuting ecocides visit www.eradicatingecocide.com The government of Canada under the stewardship of Stephen Harper has taken no action about the concern that criminal conduct, ecocide threatens our nation\u2019s future. Does that mean he does not care about our nature future?  Without a healthy environment there cannot be a future. This interview by Mary Wood a law professor highlights that the legal system is not working and enhances the concern that Canada is waiting for a dysfunctional nation to address the threats of climate destabilisation.  http://e360.yale.edu/feature/interview_mary_wood_a_legal_call_to_arms_to_fix_environmental_and_climate_ills/2724/\nIt is critical that conscious ethical citizens incorporate the understanding that politicians, corporate and organized crime can cause extensive damage to our environment, the web of life and call for laws to stop and or prosecute those committing ecocide.", "id": "10151981302584961_153824656", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2014, 1, 7, 15], "full_picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDzf5khfq6c1uYA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbc.ca%2Fpolopoly_fs%2F1.2485660%21%2FcpImage%2FhttpImage%2Fimage.jpg_gen%2Fderivatives%2F16x9_460%2Fharper-protest.jpg", "caption": "cbc.ca", "edge": "posts", "link": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/climate-change-activists-disrupt-stephen-harper-event-1.2485534", "shares": {"count": 232}, "urls": [{"components": {"fragment": "", "netloc": "cbc.ca", "params": "", "query": {}, "path": ["news", "politics", "climate-change-activists-disrupt-stephen-harper-event-1.2485534"], "scheme": "http"}, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/climate-change-activists-disrupt-stephen-harper-event-1.2485534", "driver": null, "ea": {"ea.campaign.id": null, "ea.client.id": null}, "redir": {"service": null, "url": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/climate-change-activists-disrupt-stephen-harper-event-1.2485534", "surl": null, "key": "f6f0ed082c66943234e260399a298e89", "aurora": false, "history": []}, "landing": "http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/climate-change-activists-disrupt-stephen-harper-event-1.2485534", "key": "f6f0ed082c66943234e260399a298e89", "petition": null}], "created_time": "2014-01-07T15:52:49+0000", "message": "Yesterday two environmental activists in B.C. crashed Prime Minister Stephen Harper's meeting to deliver a special message: CLIMATE JUSTICE NOW!\n\nShare if you agree!\n\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/climate-change-activists-disrupt-stephen-harper-event-1.2485534", "total": {"new": 75.6853396901, "months": {"1": 839}, "reeng": {"1": 635, "3": 124, "2": 38, "4": 42}, "month": 100.0}, "type": "link", "id": "19750184960_10151981302584961", "description": "Two climate change activists managed to sneak up behind Prime Minister Stephen Harper on Monday just as he was getting ready to start a question and answer session at the Vancouver Board of Trade."}
