We want to protect and improve our rivers so that we, our children and our grandchildren, can safely swim in them. That\u2019s a major challenge given the competing demands for water and more intensive use of land bordering many of our waterways. \n\nThe Morgan Foundation has created My River to go into bat for healthier rivers and clean water \u2013 central to our quality of life. \n\nWe got a bunch of scientists together to tell us what\u2019s going on in our rivers, and help us review government fresh water policy.
