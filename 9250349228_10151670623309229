While you waste supporters money on this kind of nonsense, you still refuse to support hemp as an environmental solution. You can't argue with it as an ideal alternative to cotton, a far superior source of paper, clothing, material, concrete, food, fibre, medicine. You can't deny it is an incredibly beneficial crop that detoxifies soil, prevents soil erosion, is carbon neutral and can grow virtually anywhere. You can't deny that hemp is so vital to helping to save the planet you simply cannot provide most of these solutions with out it. You can't deny it, so you ignore it. Meanwhile you divert attention, money, time and resources into meaningless campaigns like this that will achieve precisely nothing. Shame on you Greenpeace, you are a disgrace.", "id": "10151667982744229_8710643", "user_likes": false}]}}
