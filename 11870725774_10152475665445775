The rig now hasn't moved towards the drilling site again during the 40 hour occupation.\n\nBear Island, a unique wildlife refuge in the Barents Sea, would be completely engulfed by an oil spill within a week if Statoil\u2019s planned rig leaks. Unless we act, this unique ecosystem would be lost.\n\nThe Norwegian government owns 67% of the company. They have the power to stop Statoil from drilling in these very sensitive Arctic areas. Norway\u2019s Environment Minister, Tine Sundtoft, decides whether Statoil can pursue their plans and has the power to withdraw permission. We\u2019re calling on people everywhere to tell Norway to act.\n\nThe Arctic is under increasing pressure from oil companies that are seeking to exploit the oil and gas believed to exist under the sea floor. But drilling in the treacherous ice-filled waters of the Arctic Ocean is not safe. In these conditions, an oil spill is considered impossible to clean up and would have devastating consequences for wildlife, the Arctic environment and the people living here.\n\nLet\u2019s act together to stop these reckless plans, before it\u2019s too late.
