Tell oil companies to clean up their spills! http://grnpc.org/Ig0v7\n \nTatiana Kozhevina lives in Kolva - a village with approximately 200 years of history. She sings in the folk choir \"Pelys\" (translated as \"Ashberry\" from Komi language). Her ancestors lived in these lands long before active oil exploration started in the Komi Region. Tatyana remembers an accident in 1984 very well, when there were more than 100 tonnes of oil spilled in the Pechora basin and the Pechora Bay. \"The first oil spill which I remember was scary. Layers of oil floated down the river, - says Tatiana - '1984 - it was a terrible year. Our husbands\u2026 my husband and son were collecting this oil. They were covered by oil from top to bottom. And the boats were covered in oil too. It was the same the last year. And this year too. Oil floats down the river every year. We even have a song about our Komi land that was taken away and only snow remained. And this snow was black. I remember how the birds were dying on the river. Swans could not even fly. Muskrats  were swimming in black oil. We often go to the forest and even see that oil remains hanging right on the tree branches.\"\n \nRemind oil companies to take care of nature and to clean up after themselves: http://grnpc.org/Ig0v7", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"1": 51, "3": 53, "2": 63, "5": 246, "4": 99, "7": 28, "6": 65}, "reeng": {"10": 551, "2": 4, "5": 4, "4": 14, "7": 4, "6": 10, "9": 3, "8": 15}, "month": 8.4297520661}, "type": "photo", "id": "190271334431746_551626704962872", "petition": null, "comments": {"months": {"1": 1, "5": 3}, "reeng": {"10": 3, "4": 1}, "month": 25.0, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "NQ==", "before": "NQ=="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/190271334431746_551626704962872/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=883483195046454|9nfpAUxoDRMZ77lLiQ83CrnaV3s&after=NQ%3D%3D"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 5, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "1072079746139594", "name": "Victoria Ordonez Dellachiesa"}, "like_count": 5, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-08-13T02:41:40+0000", "message": "They want only the money but no the responsibility of their mess .", "id": "551476844977858_551714054954137", "user_likes": false}]}}
