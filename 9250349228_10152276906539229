We know that so many of you will, like us, be hugely disappointed with this news.\n \nBut while we wait for the dust to settle, and decide how we next respond, let's also remember how far we've come. Our petition calling on MPs to vote against Cameron's plan stands at 360,000 strong -- an incredible number. And while this awful law was approved today, last minute amendments were added to protect our national parks and keep our drinking water safe.\n \nUnder the weight of huge public pressure, the consensus on fracking is crumbling. And the evidence that the industry is bad for the environment and for the climate grows week after week.\n \nWe'll be in touch again soon, to share ideas and work out where we go next.
