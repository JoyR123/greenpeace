But when I see all these beautiful photos of trees that people relate to - selected by a \"National Geographic Photographer\" - well then I'm filled with sadness. Why? Answer: The lonely tree! What is a tree without a forest? It is incredibly beautiful photos. But for me, it becomes something else. When the world largest nature photo magazine choose the alone, urban, vulnerable, often dead tree - the tree which is in of us created deserts, the last dying tree, the tree surrounded by people, the tree in the city. Yes, grief is the word. But the \"National Geographic Photographer\" - call it the \"Tree of Life\" - the opposite is closer to the truth.
