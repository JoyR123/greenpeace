The truth must be seen - please SHARE this video far and wide http://youtu.be/_JgwL0ohvXA\n\nUK brands Princes Group and John West UK don't want anyone to see this footage - because this is the type of fishing still used to produce their tinned tuna. They promised to clean up back in 2011. But now they're about to break that promise.\n\nIn NZ and Australia we have had some success http://act.gp/10B7YRy getting big brands (including John West) to commit to going FAD-free but the good behaviour hasn't yet caught on in the UK. \n\nPLEASE SHARE THIS VIDEO ... IT'S A STORY THAT MUST BE TOLD.\n\nThe shocking scenes in this leaked footage http://youtu.be/_JgwL0ohvXA comes from tuna fishing operations using Fish Aggregation Devices (FADs). They attract all types of marine life, including sharks, rays and turtles, which get caught in giant nets before being tossed overboard, dead or dying.\n\nMajor UK supermarkets like Tesco, Morrisons, and Sainsburys have all banned FADs from their own-brand tuna. But John West in the UK and Princes lag behind.\n\nAfter heavy public campaigning in 2011, both promised to go 100% FAD-free. Princes promised to cut out FADs by the end of this year, but with three months left to go, less than a quarter of their tuna is FAD-Free. And John West promised to clean up their tuna by 2016 - but now our intelligence is that they want to re-write their promise and keep using FADs.\n\nWatch and share: http://youtu.be/_JgwL0ohvXA", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"10": 90, "1": 169, "3": 54, "2": 62, "5": 39, "4": 68, "7": 39, "6": 29, "9": 39, "8": 43}, "reeng": {"10": 391, "3": 15, "2": 124, "5": 11, "4": 37, "7": 11, "6": 17, "9": 13, "8": 13}, "month": 26.7405063291}, "type": "photo", "id": "11870725774_10152807983755775", "petition": null, "comments": {"months": {"10": 14, "1": 34, "3": 1, "2": 9, "5": 6, "4": 9, "7": 3, "6": 3, "9": 4, "8": 6}, "reeng": {"10": 42, "3": 3, "2": 30, "4": 5, "7": 1, "6": 1, "9": 2, "8": 5}, "month": 38.202247191, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "OTM=", "before": "OTM="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/11870725774_10152807983755775/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=OTM%3D"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 93, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "10205386019307976", "name": "Elizabeth Cutts"}, "like_count": 35, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-10-21T22:29:02+0000", "message": "lets take fish out of supermarket chains and back into specialty shops. lets increase the minimum size for snapper for commercial fishing. they are pathetically small!! heres a good one...if you want fish for dinner, maybe you should have to catch it yourself. and when you cant because the rivers are too dirty then you might do something about them too.", "id": "10152807940855775_10152808220775775", "user_likes": false}]}}
