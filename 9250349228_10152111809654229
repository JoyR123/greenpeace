It boasts speakers from the UNFCCC, UK government, academics, and industry, and advertises itself as \"a unique opportunity to network with senior officials from businesses, government, NGO's and academic institutions\". And its headline corporate sponsor is Shell.\n\nShell bankrolls climate change denier groups.\nShell has just asked the US government to grant it 5 more years to drill in the fragile Alaskan Arctic.\nShell has still not cleaned up decades' worth of pollution in the Niger Delta.\nShell's entire business model depends on a world that continues to drill for fossil fuels into the 2050s instead of taking climate change seriously.\n\nHow does this company get to top the big-name conference agenda while people on the front lines of climate disaster are not even invited?\n\nJoin us to protest outside the conference at 8.30am on Tuesday 4th November."}
