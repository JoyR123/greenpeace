Keeping  it silent  hidden yet I was shaking I was scarred and no one understood what I was trying to explain, what it was that I was experiencing. I was terrified of the monster within me. I needed to overcome the tremendous debilitating fear for the sake of my children...and I did....and I did it by filling my mind with possitive readings and staying away and switching off from things that scare me...I did....and it was the greatest  fight of my life...I did it for the love I have for my children..and if you can overcome  your fear of fear you have unbelievable courage and endurance... :)", "id": "10154016105158849_10154019010098849", "user_likes": false}]}}
