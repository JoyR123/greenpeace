So we wanted to share this petition from our friends at the Australian Marine Conservation Society demanding the WA Government rethink this terrible policy.\n\nWhile every shark-related death at sea is tragic, Greenpeace strongly opposes the culling of sharks as a response. Many experts agree that culling is not an effective solution to this complex issue, plus sharks are an incredibly important part of our marine ecosystems.\n\nHumans already kill an estimated 100 million sharks every year which has led to many species becoming endangered. Please sign and share this petition to take a stand against shark culling in WA.", "total": {"new": 59.9832214765, "months": {"1": 1192}, "reeng": {"10": 29, "1": 715, "3": 211, "5": 124, "7": 69, "9": 44}, "month": 100.0}, "type": "link", "id": "9480502970_10151917696002971", "description": "Australian Marine Conservation Society"}
