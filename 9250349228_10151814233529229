An absolute dedication for the TRUTH is what make a person a scientist.\n\nThe climate change denialists have effectively moved over to the dark side. They are trading in TRUE science for money! And lets be clear about one thing, denying something does not make it a debate, I can deny that I need oxygen to live but there is clearly no debate, I absolutely need oxygen to live. Deny is not debate.\n\nA child playing with a compass and honestly trying to understand why it points in one direction is more of a scientist than these dirty 'scientists'. They do not even deserve to be called scientist.\n\nThe truth is, the scientific community is unanimous about the human populations effect on climate change. Anyone who disagrees is either ignorant, stupid, bribed or all three. \n\nThere is no debate about the science. Only political debate remains and politics moves too slowly to save this planet! More needs to be done but yes we also must vote!\n\nI guess I would suggest the Green Party", "id": "10151814233529229_10151814312789229", "user_likes": false}]}, "from": {"category": "Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)", "name": "Greenpeace UK", "category_list": [{"id": "2235", "name": "Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)"}], "id": "9250349228"}, "object_id": "10151814233529229", "type": "video", "petition": null, "context": {"cc": "UK", "lang": "EN", "nro": "UKL"}, "full_picture": "https://fbcdn-vthumb-a.akamaihd.net/hvthumb-ak-xaf1/v/t15.0-10/s720x720/1489564_10151814234744229_10151814233529229_49458_902_b.jpg?oh=f995fcec2961cfc54dd85f8f961f279f&oe=56311FFF&__gda__=1441393643_5cf820787a49a7c943b769308a117b2b", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/greenpeaceuk/videos/10151814233529229/", "name": "Why should anyone care about the European elections?", "edge": "posts", "urls": [], "basket": null, "likes": {"months": {"1": 117, "3": 95, "2": 103, "5": 181, "4": 82}, "reeng": {"10": 400, "3": 7, "2": 78, "5": 10, "4": 32, "7": 6, "6": 20, "9": 11, "8": 14}, "month": 20.2422145329, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "OTI1NjExMjUwODE0NjQx", "before": "OTI1NjExMjUwODE0NjQx"}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/9250349228_10151814233529229/likes?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=OTI1NjExMjUwODE0NjQx"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 591}, "data": [{"id": "925611250814641", "name": "Nathan Dawson"}]}}
