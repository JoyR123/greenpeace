They give so much value and improved quality of life for every type of organism and living being on this planet. Whether is be through fruit, seeds, leaves, branches, roots, herbs, wood, or peace of mind and tranquility- trees change our lives in many ways. Growing up in the Redwood Forests of California, I have come to love the giant Sequoias. These majestic trees are among the tallest and largest in the world, a spectacular sight for any of my fellow nature lovers:) I wish I could bring them to South Africa! Sadly, mankind- though not all- tends to be destructive towards mother earth, therefore is essential that each and every person on this planet recognize the importance of trees and their influences on fundamental aspects of this world. Greenpop Platbos Reforest Fest is a great opportunity for the community to come together and show the rest of Africa how to be more conscious towards trees! I would absolutely love to go and be a part of the planting, atmosphere, music, and symbolism of this festival! :)", "id": "10152872032518849_10152872757398849", "user_likes": false}]}}
