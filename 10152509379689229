Here in Croatia crazy things are happening, beside all madness that our government is doing to people they now want to drill our sea. Selling our sea and coast to foreign oil companies will step by step turn this beautiful place on earth in to polluted and ugly area just cause they see money in that move and nothing else! They are even changing laws about referendums to stop citizens of this country to decide what is best for their country and sea. Is this thing we call democracy ??? I know many people here and not a single soul agree on this government move .. our sea is clean, beautiful and for many generations of Croatians and our friends tourist from all over the world this was ( and still is ) place to have great fun !! Just to mention some really beautiful places that many people around the world know about: Dubrovnik. Split, Brac , Krk, Hvar, Rab, Briuni, Vis, Zadar\u2026.all that will be surrounded with oil platforms and exposed to potential danger. We are known as country of 1000 islands. but if this goes thru life here will never be same .. landscape will change to worst nightmare , if any of this platforms explodes our sea will be ugliest on planet . Slogan that our goverment placed in world for this touristic season is \"FULL OF LIFE\" but might happened that in next few years it turn to \"FULL OF OIL\". Nobody here wants that. so please help us stop this madness maybe somehow this message catch somebody out of Croatia who can say to out government that this is no good and that word change their minds\u2026 they just don't want to listen their own people so please share this wherever you can !!! thank you, \nPlease, help us if you can!
