But the recent storms have stopped small boats like theirs from even getting into the water for months now. It's not been on the news as much as big flooded homes, but for them, it's a really serious problem.\n\nThese guys have a long journey ahead of them to replace equipment destroyed by the storms, let alone recovering from months without any income.

We are talking small scale fishing here, not trawlers. For a lot of these fishermen and women, I'm sure this is probably the only line of work they have ever known and it is a a family business, they live by the sea for goodness sake, what else are they supposed to do for a living!  If you want to vent your spleen at fishing go aim it at one of the big trawling companies who do far more damage and are not interested in sustainability, just profit. ALSO, trolls it is Greenpeace, not green peace, you ignoramuses! Plus, I'm sure a vast number of Greenpeace supporters are already Vegetarian, Vegan or are careful what they eat (ie low-meat/fish intake and from ethical source) otherwise they wouldn't support a cause that cares about the environment would they.
