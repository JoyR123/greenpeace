We understand that the way the economy is currently set up requires the use of cars and a reliance on the oil industry. \n\nBut with all the sustainable strides countries around the world are taking to develop green energy and end their dependence on fossil fuels, why can't Canada do the same? \n\nIn May, 74% of Germany\u2019s power needs were generated from renewables.\n\nIndia\u2019s newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an incredible plan to use solar to supply electricity to over 400 million Indians who currently don\u2019t have it.\n\nAnd despite the Alberta governments tar sands blinders, things are also starting to change here. Fort Chipewyan (where Leo just visited), one of the communities most heavily hurt by the tar sands, has started investing in solar.\n\nFossil fuels won't last forever and they are having devastating effects on the environment. We still has a way to go but a green energy Canada is possible. The future is sunny.\n \nAnd now...here's Leonardo DiCaprio challenging Stephen Harper to the #ALS #IceBucketChallenge.", "total": {"new": 26.064516129, "months": {"1": 310, "3": 88, "2": 133, "5": 40, "4": 59, "7": 40, "6": 30, "8": 75}, "reeng": {"10": 289, "1": 202, "3": 48, "2": 97, "5": 31, "4": 30, "7": 15, "6": 31, "9": 12, "8": 20}, "month": 40.0}, "type": "video", "id": "19750184960_10152480099844961", "description": "Hello from Lake Athabasca, we're here learning about the Canadian tar sands.
