For solar panels to be cost effective and competitive with other energy sources they need to be clean, be as perpendicular to the sun as possible and not shaded by trees, nearby buildings, and traffic driving over them. Not to mention the insane cost of making a solar roadway compared to a regular solar panel. \n\nWhy not support putting simple solar panels over the many 1000s of miles of water canals we have in the US? The panels' instillation has many additional benefits: \n\nThe panels over the canals will not only \"generate power, they'll block the water below from the sun's glare to deter evaporation\u2014meaning more of the water moving through the canals will be available for crop irrigation and drinking. The coolness of the water, in turn, will keep the panels at a more efficient operating temperature.\" http://deshgujarat.com/2014/02/12/cm-to-lay-stone-for-10-mw-canal-top-solar-power-plant-in-vadodara/", "id": "10152633572614684_10152642247824684", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2014, 8, 5, 0], "full_picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQA5Qgb13zYDOWum&url=http%3A%2F%2Fupw-prod-images.global.ssl.fastly.net%2Fnugget%2F539215598d1821456e00005e%2Fbrusaws-348629ef7ea7e5421bef0dd5596a2497.jpg", "caption": "upworthy.com", "edge": "posts", "link": "http://www.upworthy.com/how-a-couple-from-middle-america-became-a-national-sensation-and-a-target-for-criticism?c=gp1", "shares": {"count": 126}, "urls": [], "created_time": "2014-08-05T00:00:00+0000", "message": "You have to admit it \u2014 solar roadways would be pretty cool.", "total": {"new": 4.7554347826, "months": {"1": 53, "3": 64, "2": 71, "5": 68, "4": 70, "7": 83, "6": 65, "8": 262}, "reeng": {"10": 603, "1": 35, "3": 13, "2": 9, "5": 17, "4": 14, "7": 14, "6": 13, "9": 9, "8": 9}, "month": 7.2010869565}, "type": "link", "id": "5435784683_10152633572614684", "description": "Things that matter.
