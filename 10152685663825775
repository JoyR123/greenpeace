Sign the petition to stop them: www.savethearctic.org\n\nThe company is lurching forward despite the flood of reports from government agencies and environmental groups that Arctic drilling is too risky, that the Arctic is too vulnerable, and that Shell itself is too incompetent to proceed.\n\nThis is a red flag for the millions of us around the world who want to save the Arctic from catastrophe. We can all challenge Shell's reckless plans.\n\nPLEASE SHARE this and ASK your community to join the movement to #SaveTheArctic from Shell: >>> www.savethearctic.org", "datetime": [2014, 8, 30, 2], "pid": 11870725774, "comments": {"months": {"1": 12, "3": 6, "2": 4, "5": 1, "4": 4, "7": 6, "6": 1, "8": 4}, "reeng": {"10": 17, "1": 11, "2": 1, "5": 2, "4": 2, "7": 3, "6": 1, "9": 1}, "month": 31.5789473684, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "NDA=", "before": "NDA="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/10152685663825775/comments?access_token=192154930871376%7CUId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&pretty=0&summary=1&limit=1&after=NDA%3D"}, "new": 28.9473684211, "summary": {"total_count": 40, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "10153260132824286", "name": "TheDan Rodgers"}, "like_count": 28, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-08-30T07:23:46+0000", "message": "Hold on a sec. Who did they get permission from? Lets think about this for a sec. \nLets start from the bottom.\n\nThe world is one huge ball with different layers and land masses divided by oceans. On an interpretation we see lines and boundaries chopping it up into countries. When I walk across from one country to another I don't see these lines in the ground or different coloured soil to tell me I am in a different country and have to follow a different set of rules. They are imposed by humans. They are imaginary boundaries set by the loss of life over many generations and  by the trading of tokens (money) with a value that changes in a dictations by someone, or certain other negotiations. You can't eat these tokens. You can't drink these tokens. Most of these tokens you don't even see because they are on a screen. My guess is that there is probably more virtual tokens than actual physical ones. Many many people have died for these both tokens and boundaries alike. People have died for what can be found on some of these boundaries. People still die for these lines drawn on a map. These boundaries are governed in different ways by a body of \u201cleaders\u201d elected by the people as a whole. They elect these \u201cleaders\u201d in a mutual understanding that they will make the best decisions for that country and with the wants of the people. Unfortunately many of these \u201cleaders\u201d don't actually act on on behalf of the people and make decisions based on getting them into the next election. On many occasions they don't give you the full picture but just enough to help justify decisions they make so you feel they have done the right thing. Unfortunately these leaders realise that they are doing something against the masses wishes. When the people realise this they will fight the leaders. The people own the country. The people own the planet. The government don't. They are your agent. They are there to liase the decisions you want made make and when they fail to do this they should be held accountable.\n\nWho owns these \"sell-able rights\" to allow for the big corporations to mine this planet for things we don't even need to survive? Truth is the planet does. Shell owns the equipment. They have the labour. But actually. We already own the oil. It's part of the planet we all own. If they charge for anything it should really only be for they services and maintenance of their machinery. Like a lawn mower man. You pay for them to mow a lawn you own. \n\nThe investment into using green renewable resources is something these powers-that-be should be investing their time and money in. The Governments give permission to the big business to take from the ground what belongs to the planet collectively. \n\nBut how does this seem to be ok? Where do we get the idea that it is ok to create long term damage to make people temporarily rich? This whole mind set of using everything up and messing up the planet is a 'Baby Boomer\" mentality to everything. \"I'm not here when it's all messed up so what do I care.\" Future generations are the ones that suffer so those can get ahead in the now with tokens that will never be eternal. \n\nThe \"resources\" of the world belong to everyone collectively. No one has a right to sell that which doesn't belong to them. In any other case this would be theft. Shell would be the receiver of stolen goods and the Government selling what doesn't belong to them would be the thief. For anybody else the would be taken to court. \n\nThat's how I perceive it anyway.", "id": "10152685663825775_10152686812625775", "user_likes": false}]}, "height": 669, "created_time": "2014-08-30T02:05:00+0000", "width": 720, "edge": "objects", "likes": {"months": {"1": 239, "3": 89, "2": 135, "5": 84, "4": 67, "7": 60, "6": 72, "8": 173}, "reeng": {"10": 566, "1": 155, "3": 48, "2": 18, "5": 32, "4": 25, "7": 30, "6": 17, "9": 14, "8": 14}, "month": 26.0065288357, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxNTI4NzA4ODEyMjc1NDc=", "before": "MTAxNTI4NzA4ODEyMjc1NDc="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/10152685663825775/likes?access_token=192154930871376%7CUId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&pretty=0&summary=1&limit=1&after=MTAxNTI4NzA4ODEyMjc1NDc%3D"}, "new": 16.8661588683, "summary": {"total_count": 937}, "data": [{"id": "10152870881227547", "name": "Lawrence Mark"}]}, "urls": [{"components": {"fragment": "", "netloc": "savethearctic.org", "params": "", "query": {}, "path": [""], "scheme": "http"}, "url": "http://www.savethearctic.org", "driver": null, "ea": {"ea.campaign.id": null, "ea.client.id": null}, "redir": {"service": null, "url": "http://www.savethearctic.org", "surl": null, "key": "0b57f71d1b081f75fa3d5841d59b76cb", "aurora": false, "history": []}, "landing": "http://www.savethearctic.org", "key": "0b57f71d1b081f75fa3d5841d59b76cb", "petition": {"cc": "WW", "basket": "polar", "issue": "save the arctic"}}], "images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/10659178_10152685663825775_2757500094671993100_n.jpg?oh=843d2fc59b0a26f6185fa9e323d20e31&oe=55C154CC", "height": 697, "width": 750}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p600x600/10659178_10152685663825775_2757500094671993100_n.jpg?oh=2c72fdea87e5c8ce432a924aae3fe21a&oe=55C01BFC", "height": 600, "width": 645}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p480x480/10659178_10152685663825775_2757500094671993100_n.jpg?oh=ca32eaadd8e342dc7ddc271400e661b2&oe=55CA06C6", "height": 480, "width": 516}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p320x320/10659178_10152685663825775_2757500094671993100_n.jpg?oh=be01074ba5133c673d2edfc94021487f&oe=56063084", "height": 320, "width": 344}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/10659178_10152685663825775_2757500094671993100_n.jpg?oh=98fd77f7452880376734be3bade79a2b&oe=55F68CA1", "height": 540, "width": 581}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p130x130/10659178_10152685663825775_2757500094671993100_n.jpg?oh=176dda1bb8dabe32573068b1b9ac361e&oe=560D8B94", "height": 130, "width": 139}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p75x225/10659178_10152685663825775_2757500094671993100_n.jpg?oh=47846e43e7f3d3d98c1a525abae2475c&oe=560D27EA", "height": 225, "width": 242}], "total": {"new": 17.2523961661, "months": {"1": 246, "3": 93, "2": 137, "5": 85, "4": 68, "7": 62, "6": 73, "8": 175}, "reeng": {"10": 573, "1": 162, "3": 48, "2": 18, "5": 33, "4": 26, "7": 33, "6": 18, "9": 14, "8": 14}, "month": 26.1980830671}, "id": "10152685663825775"}
