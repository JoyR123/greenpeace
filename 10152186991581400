I also saw that kind of harvesting of sharks' fins. I sympathise with your feelings towards those creatures. But . . . . have you been to the slaughter houses and also got to look at the eyes of cattle being killed so that there will be patties for burgers served at McDo or other fastfood chains? I understand that feelings and it had to come from kind and godly heart. But then, this is my personal view on the matter, there are so many ways to preserve all creatures deemed important. Like what they are doing with seeds of every known plant. Same manner with sharks I think. Nursery for every species maybe built to produce millions of eggs or whatever. We have the technology to accomplish that. But I don't agree with you that let us not eat the best tasting food on the planet because they are endangerd and it is cruelty to just leave their bodies to die.
