Invented the things Edison patented ... Was going to give free energy from the ionosphere \nBut was shot down by J P Morgan \n\nIn 1885, Tesla claimed that he could redesign Edison's inefficient motor and generators, making an improvement in both service and economy. According to Tesla, Edison remarked, \"There's fifty thousand dollars in it for you\u2014if you can do it\"[43]\u2014this has been noted as an odd statement from an Edison whose company was stingy with pay and who did not have that sort of cash on hand.[44] After months of work, Tesla fulfilled the task and inquired about payment. Edison, claiming that he was only joking, replied, \"Tesla, you don't understand our American humor.\"[45][46] Instead, Edison offered a US$10 a week raise over Tesla's US$18 per week salary; Tesla refused the offer and immediately resigned.[43]\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla", "id": "10152222446467971_10152239531977971", "user_likes": false}]}}
