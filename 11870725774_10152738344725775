Meet opposite Britomart at midday on Tuesday 30 Sept.\n\nThe Norwegian oil giant Statoil, the same company who is threatening to drill for deep sea oil off the coast of Northland (and the Arctic) are partly funding this conference.  Together we will tell Statoil and the oil industry that we want clean energy not dirty deep sea oil.\n\nThe Waiho Papa Moana hikoi is made up of Northlanders who are standing up to protect the ocean and coast for current and future generations.  They are joined by people from the East Cape (Te Whanau-a-Apanui) and Kaikoura (Ngati Kuri ki Kaikoura) who are also under threat from deep sea oil drilling.   Let\u2019s make sure they know that Aucklanders support their kaupapa."}
