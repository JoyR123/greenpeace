If we use everything up and don't look after the natural environment - there will be nothing left - or nobody left to plunder it.  What are people supposed to do?   How about what we did for a million years before becoming so greedy with the land?  We're not going to all leap from city to living off the land - but we need to learn what our impact is and be responsible for it.  Anything else is suicide.  Sorry Steve but the future needs to have more respect for living systems.  The people of the future are going to think we were wasteful assholes.  Everything we do we need to be more careful about our impact.  There are so many innovative options.  \n\nSorry Steve but I totally agree with the viewpoint of this post.  Key has the awareness of a gnat.  I am originally from Canada 10 years ago and I feel like too many NZers want to be like Americans without knowing how crap that direction really is. \n\nNZ is such a special place - unfortunately you guys are on the bandwagon to destroying what you have too.", "id": "10152748959535775_10152749126415775", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2014, 9, 28, 5], "full_picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAhqpfAiD8UEMF4&url=https%3A%2F%2Ffbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net%2Fhphotos-ak-xfa1%2Ft31.0-8%2Fs720x720%2F10680122_10152748959170775_7896560733319055203_o.jpg", "caption": "greenpeace.org", "edge": "posts", "link": "http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/blog/at-the-end-of-the-day-decision-2014/blog/50731/", "shares": {"count": 44}, "urls": [], "created_time": "2014-09-28T05:27:47+0000", "total": {"new": 4.5454545455, "months": {"1": 33, "3": 25, "2": 19, "5": 16, "4": 18, "7": 22, "6": 16, "9": 57, "8": 14}, "reeng": {"10": 176, "1": 10, "3": 5, "2": 6, "5": 2, "4": 6, "7": 5, "6": 2, "9": 6, "8": 2}, "month": 15.0}, "type": "link", "id": "11870725774_10152748959535775", "description": "Decision 2014 is over.
