Increasingly Democracy has been hijacked by corporate interests. The money needed to run for office, the money spent on lobbying by special interests, the ever increasing economic disparity and the well funded legislative decisions all favor corporate interests over the people's.\n\nThe Citizens United Supreme Court ruling is proof of this corruption as well as are the proposed trade deals which would further compromise our rights. \nThese Corporations were originally created to serve us but if we don't appropriately prioritize they will destroy us. Corporations don't have children. They don't have feelings or soul. They don't depend on uncontaminated water, clean air or healthy food to survive. They are beholden to one thing - the bottom line. \nI choose to speak Truth to this Economic Power. When I speak out on corporations hurting the common man or the environment or other species, I expect a well financed disinformation campaign to be aimed my way. \nSuch is the case with the reaction to my new album The Monsanto Years, which covers many of these issues. I support those bringing these issues to light and those who fight for their rights like Freedom of Choice. \nBut Freedom of Choice is meaningless without knowledge.\nThats why its crucial we all get engaged and get informed. \nThat's why GMO labeling matters. Mothers need to know what they are feeding their children. They need freedom to make educated choices at the market. When the people have voted for labeling, as they have in Vermont, they need our support when they are fighting these corporate interests trying to reverse the laws they have voted for and passed in the democratic process.\n\nI do not trust self serving misinformation coming from corporations and their media trolls. I do not trust politicians who are taking millions from those corporations either. I trust people. So I make my music for people not for candidates.\n\nKeep on Rockin in the Free World.\nNeil Young", "updated_time": "2015-06-19T03:32:22+0000", "source": "https://video.xx.fbcdn.net/hvideo-xfa1/v/t42.1790-2/11093381_685647324894142_2070513103_n.mp4?oh=f84478b93aa81c6cee66399bd6340a5c&oe=558C1A64", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/arctic.rising/videos/685643988227809/", "story_tags": {"46": [{"length": 15, "offset": 46, "type": "page", "id": "190271334431746", "name": "Save The Arctic"}], "0": [{"length": 38, "offset": 0, "type": "page", "id": "508987639116105", "name": "Anonymiss Art Dedicated to Christopher"}], "64": [{"length": 5, "offset": 64, "id": "685643988227809", "name": ""}]}, "created_time": "2015-06-19T03:32:22+0000", "is_hidden": false, "type": "video", "id": "508987639116105_1113182158696647", "status_type": "shared_story", "description": "Are you one of them?
