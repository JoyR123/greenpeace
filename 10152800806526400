So we decided to visit a plantation last April to see for ourselves if the rumors are true, and we were SHOCKED by what we found.\n\nAerial spraying is preferred by banana plantations because it is a cheap and easy way of administering the fungicide which targets the sigatoka fungus. However, this practice poses serious risks to plantation workers and nearby residents.\n\nThis is why several groups including Greenpeace called on Congress this week to pass the long-delayed bill banning aerial spraying in banana plantations nationwide. http://bit.ly/1BVOxlQ\n\nSHARE this video now and help us expose this dangerous practice!", "datetime": [2015, 6, 11, 9], "pid": 48688071399, "comments": {"months": {"12": 1, "1": 2, "2": 1, "4": 1, "6": 1, "9": 2}, "reeng": {"9": 1, "10": 4, "2": 2, "6": 1}, "month": 25.0, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "OA==", "before": "OA=="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/10152800806526400/comments?access_token=192154930871376%7CUId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&pretty=0&summary=1&limit=1&after=OA%3D%3D"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 8, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "881083241933011", "name": "Elson Gilza"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2015-06-13T14:13:01+0000", "message": "Even the mining activities situated in our critical watershed areas.", "id": "10152800806526400_10152805422431400", "user_likes": false}]}, "updated_time": "2015-06-11T09:17:38+0000", "edge": "videos", "likes": {"months": {"11": 5, "12": 39, "1": 7, "3": 2, "2": 3, "5": 6, "4": 2, "7": 3, "6": 1, "9": 2}, "reeng": {"10": 62, "2": 4, "5": 1, "4": 2, "6": 1}, "month": 10.0, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "NDI4MzEzMzEwNjc0ODYy", "before": "NDI4MzEzMzEwNjc0ODYy"}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/10152800806526400/likes?access_token=192154930871376%7CUId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&pretty=0&summary=1&limit=1&after=NDI4MzEzMzEwNjc0ODYy"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 73}, "data": [{"id": "428313310674862", "name": "Rose Sophia"}]}, "urls": [{"components": {"fragment": "", "netloc": "greenpeace.org", "params": "", "query": {}, "path": ["seasia", "ph", "press", "releases", "Groups-urge-Congress-to-ban-pesticide-aerial-spraying"], "scheme": "http"}, "url": "http://bit.ly/1BVOxlQ", "driver": null, "ea": {"ea.campaign.id": null, "ea.client.id": null}, "redir": {"service": "bit.ly", "url": "http://www.greenpeace.org/seasia/ph/press/releases/Groups-urge-Congress-to-ban-pesticide-aerial-spraying/", "surl": "1BVOxlQ", "key": "ca9cc937a4ef5fa51c65db27edcac574", "aurora": false, "history": ["http://bit.ly/1BVOxlQ"]}, "landing": "http://www.greenpeace.org/seasia/ph/press/releases/Groups-urge-Congress-to-ban-pesticide-aerial-spraying/", "key": "ca9cc937a4ef5fa51c65db27edcac574", "petition": null}], "created_time": "2015-06-11T09:03:40+0000", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"11": 5, "12": 39, "1": 9, "3": 2, "2": 4, "5": 6, "4": 3, "7": 3, "6": 2, "9": 3}, "reeng": {"10": 64, "2": 6, "5": 1, "4": 2, "6": 2, "9": 1}, "month": 11.8421052632}, "id": "10152800806526400"}
