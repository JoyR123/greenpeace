From the \u201ccommon core\u201d programs to other curriculums, the \u201csystem\u201d is very effective in \u201cconditioning\u201d our once free thinking and curious children. It\u2019s up to all of us to teach our children to think \u201cout of the box\u201d. It is imperative that we make our children understand the \u201cprogramming\u201d agenda of the school systems so they can remain on guard against such conditioning. Caring for our young goes far beyond their physical needs, we must help them to stay awake. We must help them to see the world for what it is through a lens that has not been colored with the bias and programing of a very self serving and twisted power structure. We must help their minds to remain truly free. http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/the-mental-programming-of-our-children/", "id": "10152831844950775_10152832095225775", "user_likes": false}]}, "from": {"category": "Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)", "name": "Greenpeace New Zealand", "category_list": [{"id": "152880021441864", "name": "Community Organization"}, {"id": "191523214199822", "name": "Environmental Conservation"}], "id": "11870725774"}, "object_id": "932563233425008", "shares": {"count": 2}, "type": "photo", "petition": null, "description": "Pass this on if you hope more NZ institutions will commit to pulling their investments out of fossil fuels.", "full_picture": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/t31.0-8/p480x480/10733748_932563233425008_6227151434681900418_o.jpg", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/GenerationZero/photos/a.302770503070954.92432.224306544250684/932563233425008/?type=1", "name": "Generation Zero", "edge": "posts", "urls": [], "basket": {"capture": "message", "name": "climate"}}
