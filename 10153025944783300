Who are the most evolved on the planet?\nWhy can't humanity live in peace?\nSeveral species, faiths, different tribes, heterogeneous convictions,... but only ONE world in which to co-exist. We are all connected on this planet. \nSo what is the problem? This goes beyond greed and selfishness. It's the failure to see this planet as a single entity that causes so much pain so many times. You cannot attack or destroy one part of the world without it affecting the whole earth. Attacking or destroying other cultures, nations, habitats, species, religions... is a self destructive act. \nEarth isn't a place to destroy. \nIt is home to all known living things (an irrevocable right). \nTo realize that everything in Earth is connected is to both accept our insignificance and understand our importance. Our duty is to be useful (this is why we are here). When we help others we help ourselves. We begin to learn wisely when we're willing to see world from the perspective of others (humans or no-humans). Help others to found what they need, is the day your real life begins. And when you do a good deed your reward usually is to be set to do another and harder and better one. Don't wait for approval from others. You were create to perform good deeds. It is a denial within us to doubt our potential and our possibilities. Possibilities that depend upon our dispositions, and not upon our circumstances.\nCompassion and understanding are the things we need most in the world. When you step up, you invite others to step up, too. It's the way the world works. \nThat is the purpose of our lives.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=685011578254627&set=a.313232038765918.77132.100002373744045&type=1&theater&viewas=100000686899395", "id": "10153025944783300_10153025951598300",
