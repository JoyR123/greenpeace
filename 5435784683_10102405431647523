Join our crew Tuesday night, January 14, for a creative action preparation at the Washington, DC office of Greenpeace. Open to those who are flexible, determined and want to help shut down KXL South.\n\nThe 485-mile southern leg of TransCanada\u2019s toxic Keystone XL tar sands pipeline has been completed, is being filled, and is scheduled to start up on January 22. Only days remain for the Obama White House to intervene and extinguish this 485-mile fuse to one of the biggest carbon bombs on Earth. \n\nOn January 15, the 85th birthday of Dr. Martin King, Jr., we will join with Interfaith Moral Action on Climate outside the White House to demand that Keystone XL\u2019s southern leg be shut down.\n\nMorality demands that President Obama exercise his executive authority to stop this project. KXL South must be shut down until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducts public hearings and water impact studies, and until the Pipeline Hazardous Materials and Safety Administration re-inspects and digs up every inch of the anomaly-plagued tar sands pipeline in Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nWe recognize the extremely short turnaround on this request, but this is an emergency situation. If you cannot attend yourself, please share this invitation with others who possibly can."}
