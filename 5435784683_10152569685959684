While living in California, my sons & I often took advantage of the several recycling programs. Including cash for cans. We'd save our recyclables all year long. Come Summer, we'd cash in several bins of cans & plastic containers. We made over $200-300 easily! It was the kids summer cash. Good for swimming lessons, ice cream and of course, brand new super soakers!! It was a win-win situation. \n\nSince leaving California, I realize not all states are up to date with the benefits of recycling. People don't quite understand the power behind it the way Californians do... California is definitely a pioneer in such \"experiments\" to save the Earth... Now, if only others would follow suit.
