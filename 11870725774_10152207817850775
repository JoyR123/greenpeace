It's a little ironic that many of the pictures of protesters on the beaches last year drove down there in large fossil fuel burning 4x4's. There must be better ways to show support that is inevitably meant to bring awareness to all the risks to our environment, particularly out coastal water, beeches etc. I think others seeing signs against oil exploration will see the hypocrisy in it and remain complacent or at the least not take that person seriously.", "id": "10152207812720775_12540407", "user_likes": false}]}}
