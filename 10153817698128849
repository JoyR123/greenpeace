My husband dropped off his  86 year old mother and myself at the gate while he went to find a parking. The queue was really long so we decided to just have a look through the fence and to take a few photos. A young lady from the Rainbow Warrior approached us and offered to take a photo of us. In conversation I mentioned that we wouldn't be going onto the ship as the queue was too long and my mother in law was too old to stand that long. To my suprise she arrange for us to go to the front of the line. A few people gave us dirty looks but we had a wonderful tour and listened to very interesting talks about the ship and it's history. I would like to thank the lady that arrange for us to be treated at VIP's. I cannot tell you how grateful my mother in law was. Everyone one was so helpful with getting her up and down the stairs.  Once again a big THANK YOU.", "id": "10153817698128849_10153820916123849", "user_likes": false}]}, "height": 321, "created_time": "2015-03-01T08:50:40+0000", "width": 640, "edge": "objects", "likes": {"months": {"11": 16, "10": 16, "12": 47, "1": 21, "3": 47, "2": 56, "5": 19, "4": 29, "7": 12, "6": 24, "9": 17, "8": 10}, "reeng": {"10": 240, "1": 21, "3": 16, "2": 6, "5": 3, "4": 9, "7": 7, "6": 2, "9": 4, "8": 6}, "month": 6.6878980892, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTY0MzU0NTI0NTg4MDI4NA==", "before": "MTY0MzU0NTI0NTg4MDI4NA=="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/10153817698128849/likes?access_token=883483195046454%7C9nfpAUxoDRMZ77lLiQ83CrnaV3s&pretty=0&summary=1&limit=1&after=MTY0MzU0NTI0NTg4MDI4NA%3D%3D"}, "new": 6.6878980892, "summary": {"total_count": 319}, "data": [{"id": "1643545245880284", "name": "Clau S\u00e1nchez"}]}, "urls": [], "images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/10995455_10153817698128849_9123379530209160577_n.jpg?oh=f8b1a99c165b81da1bbc372f4c91f660&oe=560CF3F8", "height": 321, "width": 640}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p320x320/10995455_10153817698128849_9123379530209160577_n.jpg?oh=2d3407f2e879f88d3a3a275af24fb5e6&oe=55C856B0", "height": 320, "width": 638}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p130x130/10995455_10153817698128849_9123379530209160577_n.jpg?oh=2f1d7a2297d4de003a42019a6ec3e6c6&oe=55FB3DA0", "height": 130, "width": 259}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p75x225/10995455_10153817698128849_9123379530209160577_n.jpg?oh=7c077299efe02fd1bbb464e12339725e&oe=55FE59DE", "height": 225, "width": 448}], "total": {"new": 8.0996884735, "months": {"11": 16, "10": 16, "12": 47, "1": 26, "3": 47, "2": 56, "5": 19, "4": 31, "7": 12, "6": 24, "9": 17, "8": 10}, "reeng": {"10": 242, "1": 26, "3": 16, "2": 6, "5": 3, "4": 9, "7": 7, "6": 2, "9": 4, "8": 6}, "month": 8.0996884735}, "id": "10153817698128849"}
