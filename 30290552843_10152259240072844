The police also seized communication equipment from our office during the day. \n\nLast week, a free and fair Gram Sabha was promised to the people in Mahan. These actions ensure that communication is broken between supporters like you and what is going on in Mahan. We will keep you updated with more information. \n\nIn the meantime, Please SHARE and spread the message.
