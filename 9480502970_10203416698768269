The Reef is simply too precious for us to lose.\r\n\r\nThe Great Barrier Reef is home to over 1500 species of fish, one third of the worlds soft coral as well as 6 of the 7 species of turtle of the world. The Great Barrier Reef hosts a range of protected species including endangers marine turtles, dugongs & molluscs. In addition to this, the lively tourism industry is guaranteed to suffer detrimental effects, with UNESCO recently saying that if the GBR was to be placed on the endangered list tourism would suffer greatly not only in Queensland but through-out Australia.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, our government is busy giving tax breaks to coal barons, while getting ready to cut essential services, health, welfare and education. They've also made themselves busy in approving horrendous destruction in the Leard State Forest, and plan to strip Tasmanian wilderness of heritage protection.\r\n\r\nThis is not a government concerned with people or planet and we cannot let our planet be ruined this way.\r\n\r\nSo join us this Saturday, 12:30pm at Rundle Mall in demonstrating against these attacks on our environment and the Great Barrier Reef.\r\n\r\n***ENDORSED BY THE FOLLOWING***\r\n\r\n- NUS (National Union of Students)\r\n- ASEN (Australian Student Environment Network). \r\n\r\nSpeaker: \r\n\r\nMark Parnell MLC Greens.\r\nGene Stewart-Murray \r\n(Tas State Branch Indigenous Officer NUS\r\nIndigenous officer ASEN)"}
