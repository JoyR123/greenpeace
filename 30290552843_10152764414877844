Minister Leon Bignell describes using technology that works with the soil and other organic matter. This type of innovation, that he calls an \u201cevolution in science\u201d abounds over genetic engineering, he said.\n\nThe results of the following trial experiment strengthened his view that a moratorium on GM technology should remain indefinitely as it proves that GMOs are not needed. Incidentally, this year\u2019s government test run was called \u201cNew Horizons\u201d and some of the trial sites boasted a 300% increase in yields.\n\nRead more http://netzfrauen.org/2015/03/27/topp-ganz-ohne-gvo-300-mehr-getreideernte-in-suedaustralien/\n#Netzfrauen", "id": "10152764414877844_10152766425867844", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2015, 3, 26, 15], "full_picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDyIFe3HmV8ukNT&url=http%3A%2F%2Frack.0.mshcdn.com%2Fmedia%2FZgkyMDE1LzAzLzIwLzJkL0FsYXNrYUltYWdlLjNlODExLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4NjI3IwplCWpwZw%2Ff180b365%2F957%2FAlaska-Images-of-Change-NASA-Climate-Impact.jpg", "caption": "mashable.com", "edge": "posts", "link": "http://on.mash.to/1xibQt6", "shares": {"count": 77}, "urls": [], "created_time": "2015-03-26T15:00:02+0000", "message": "Wow!
