They videoed what happened so you can see how it went - and they'd love it if you made your own calls too!\n\nHere's the Shell contact details:\nhttps://www.shell.com/global/aboutshell/contact-us.html\n\nOr you can jump over to Shell's Facebook page and leave them a message there.\n\nFollow Johno and the rest of the crew on the Greenpeace Esperanza at as they make #TheCrossing in the wake of Shell's giant Arctic-bound oil rig: www.savethearctic.org/live/\n\n#SaveTheArctic"}
