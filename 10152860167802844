This is a great video where you show how these power plants pollute the environment in many ways. But what about the other side of the story? Around 14000 Megawatts which is around 12% of india's production. and u want to stop that? Please knock some sense into yourself. Do you think a country like India with a population of 1.2 billion people can grow without this power? (This is exactly the reason why every Indian is hating you at the moment). U talk about powering the ipads and computers. And i absolutely don't believe the fact that u didn't use a computer to make this video, didn't drink water stored in a fridge  or didn't use a fan in this burning summer while you are making this video.                                            What i am trying to point out here? Please stop asking indian government to shutdown the coal plants. Instead what you can really do? Ask the corporations to put higher standards for reducing CO2 emissions from coal mines. Processing the water before dumping it into anywhere.  Using the waste heat for other purposes of generating fresh water.  http://www.canadiancleanpowercoalition.com/files/2912/7299/7032/3%20Ways%20to%20Reduce%20Emissions%20from%20Coal%20Plants%20-%20Factsheet.pdf                http://www2.epa.gov/carbon-pollution-standards   Think sustainable and address the real problem.
