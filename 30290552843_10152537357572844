Everyone eats tomatos but seems to forget that their natural variant is toxic and it took GMing them oldschool style for us to be able to eat them. \nPeople should focus on more pressing matters, like habitat loss and resource depletion. GMOs is what's going to keep us alive, so if y'alls don't want to eat them, you should stop eating anything. Jut because technology allows us to modify organisms faster does not mean it has never been done in other ways. All our vehetables and meat products are produced from genetic manipulation. This is so annoying to see. Spend the energy wasted on opposing GMOs on something like pollution or landscape degradation.", "id": "10152537349837844_10152537974877844", "user_likes": false}]}}
