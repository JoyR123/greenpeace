Not sure how these numbers work as I am certain that nuclear uses considerably less water than coal (most of it will be recaptured/recycled as it has to be heavily purified prior to use).\n\nNuclear plant design has improved considerably over the last 30 years or more and it is impossible to have a meltdown (and I do mean IMPOSSIBLE) like that of Chernobyl, which so many anti-nuke people like to use to justify their argument. The Fukishima death toll (and overall environmental disaster) while bad was also nowhere near as catastrophic as made out to be by the media, and still killed considerably fewer people than all the coal pollutants that are thrown up into the air every year by coal fired power stations.\n\nThe world needs more power, a lot more and renewable is just not economically viable at this point (or practical for many countries) so while we should all be striving towards that goal, get rid of the greenhouse gas generating coal and oil fired power stations and go nuclear! The advent of the electric car is also going to place more demand on the utility grids of the near future.", "id": "10153889223488849_10153890956443849", "user_likes": false}]}}
