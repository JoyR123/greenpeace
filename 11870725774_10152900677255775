The bureau warned of storm surges of up to 4.5 meters and heavy to torrential rainfall within the typhoon\u2019s 600 km diameter. \n\nDetails of how communities are holding up in the storm\u2019s path were not immediately clear, Greenpeace said it is standing in solidarity with the people of the Philippines who are once again facing a devastating extreme weather event. \n\nSpeaking from the Philippines where he intends to bear witness to the aftermath of the typhoon, Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said:\n\n\u201cOur hearts are with the people of the Philippines tonight, with all whose loved ones are potentially in peril. We express our deepest solidarity and sympathy for a strong and proud nation at risk of another disaster, just one year after Typhoon Haiyan struck the same region.\n\n\u201cPeople are still struggling to rebuild their lives and grieving for loved ones lost. We hope this typhoon will spare them of similar pain. At first opportunity, I will travel to these communities and stand in solidarity with them.\n\n\u201cIt is a tragedy that the price of climate change is being paid by those who carry no blame for its causes. Our climate is changing at an alarming rate and now more than ever, urgent climate action has become an issue of survival.\u201d\n\nNaidoo intends to travel to the impacted region together with Philippine climate negotiator Naderev \u2018Yeb\u2019 M. Sano and Greenpeace Southeast Asia Executive Director Von Hernandez.\nContact:\n\nTherese Salvador, Media Campaigner, Greenpeace Southeast Asia\nEmail: therese.salvador@greenpeace.org\nMobile: +63 (0) 917 822 8734\n\nGreenpeace International pressdesk\nEmail: pressdesk.int@greenpeace.org\nPhone: +31 (0) 20 718 2470"}
