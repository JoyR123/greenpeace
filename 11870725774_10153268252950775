Let us know if you are organising an event and we will work with you to get the word out!\n\n- MOBILISE your friends, family and everyone else to support this day to send a strong message that we care about our trees!\n\n- On the day - make signs, take photos, share stories, get on social media with the hashtags #StopTheChop and #SaveTheRMA \n\n- Be mindful of BIOSECURITY measures around Kauri forest - get in touch with your local DOC office and ask for some spray and a brush - then assign someone on the day to make sure everyone has their shoes sprayed!\n\n- Please email us (@ thewildernerd@hotmail.com) with stories and pictures of your trees. \n\nWe want to hear your stories. We want to make them heard. \n\nYour story can be long or short, it can be about a single tree or your whole community, it can be a poem, it could be a picture. Share what your local trees mean to you, how they have shaped your community or how you've had to fight or are fighting to protect them!\n\nIf your group would like to support the day please email thewildernerd@hotmail.com\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nAfter the Kauri and Rimu trees in Paturoa Road were almost cut down, we realised this wasn\u2019t just about 2 trees, it was about a nation of communities and their trees left unheard and  unprotected.\n\nA community came together in Titirangi to #SaveOurKauri and Rimu, we occupied the Kauri tree for 81 hours and the trees are safe for now. We saw an example of people\u2019s readiness to stand up for what they care about - with over 26,000 signatures for the petition. Since then we have received messages from around the country of other native trees at threat or that have already been lost due to lack of protection and consultation through local authorities and under the RMA*.\n\n*The Resource Management Act 1991 is a piece of NZ legislation with the purpose to oversee how resources and the environment are managed. It is the main way that ordinary NZer\u2019s can have a say in these issues."}
