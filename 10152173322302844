Due to this China has decided to move its coal fired plants far away from the cities, but that is a daunting task. The lesser said about the almost slave labour employed in China the better. Forcible land acquisitions, displacement etc in the name of \"economic development\"?? Sorry, but that's too high a price for something that is a human rights disaster as well as an ecological one. Open your minds and feel the fresh air in the mountains for one and then compare what price we are paying (rather the next generation) is paying for this supposed \"development\" The Indian government ranks in the bottom 10 percentile according to Transparency International which tracks corruption in the Indian government. The amount of black money stashed abroad in tax havens is mond boggling and is allegedly the highest in the world making Indian corporate czars the biggest fraudsters and tax evaders around the world. And yet, if any organization is doing genuine good work WITH full transparency and following the FCRA Rules, they are beeing bullied by the governments so as to assist their corporate \"donors\" in raping and pillaging our beautiful country and selling off all natural resources for a song and say damn to environment, ecology or human rights of people.
