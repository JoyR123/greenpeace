There is no campaigning organisation that I have ever come across that is perfect, perfect, perfect. GP do their best to inform and rally people who care. WHY do you criticisers pick up on everything they have not done or have not done yet? What do you expect for your donation or support? Are you perfect? Have they stolen your money or your hopes?  Are you criticising because you are afraid they will succeed in some way or more likely are you really afraid that they will fail and we will lose our world to worse turmoil and pollution than we have now. I am really really afraid for my grandchildren and am just glad there are Greenpeace activists who dont lay down and moan like so many of the commentators. Carry on Greenpeace, Do your best for us that that dont do much more than think or write about it and I will support you till my last days.
