His approval would see 3 million cubic metres of dredging and dumping in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.\n\nMore than 45,000 Greenpeace supporters have urged Minister Hunt to make the right decision for our Reef and climate, and now it\u2019s time to bring the message home. This Friday at 1pm, we'll gather outside Minister Hunt's office in Hastings and call on him to save the Reef from coal. Can you join us?\n\nWhen: 1pm, 21st July\n \nWhere: Greg Hunt\u2019s electoral office, Shop 4/184 Salmon Street, Hastings Vic 3915\n \nWho: Greenpeace supporters, GetUp supporters, local environment and action groups.\n\nWe encourage you to bring placards and come dressed in colourful clothes to represent the colours of the Great Barrier Reef. You could come along in floaties, flippers or with a snorkel!\n \nHunt has already delayed his decision once; he knows Australians are dead against this destructive mine and its impact on the Reef \u2013 now we must ramp up the pressure to make him reject Carmichael mine once and for all.\n\nThe event will be fun, family friendly and shouldn't take more than an hour all up. We'll gather together, meet like-minded people and take some photos. Then, we'll have a chat about the challenges our Reef is facing, before delivering a message that Hunt won't be able to ignore. \n\nEverything is organised, now all we need is you. Join us this Friday to take action for our Reef."}
