Did you know that Duke Energy wants to raise your monthly bills to bailout Ohio\u2019s oldest, dirtiest, and least economic coal plants? They want you and your fellow neighbors pay over $100 million!\n\nFortunately, YOU CAN PREVENT THIS! Attend the final public hearing on this Thursday, Sept. 18 at City Hall to let commissioners of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) know that you will not sustain an industry of dirty energy.  \n\nRegister here:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/273437089522284/ ", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"9": 3, "1": 1, "3": 1, "7": 1, "6": 2}, "reeng": {"10": 8}, "month": 12.5}, "type": "event", "id": "5435784683_10152735742979684", "description": "Duke Energy, along with Ohio\u2019s other electric utilities, have quietly filed and are trying right now behind the scenes to bailout a number of Ohio\u2019s oldest, dirtiest, and least economic coal plants. What\u2019s worse, they want you and I to pay for it.\n\n \nIt\u2019s not right. It\u2019s not fair. And even if you\u2019re not buying your power from Duke, you\u2019re still going to be stuck paying for their dirty coal bailout! And if you're a Cincinnati resident under the aggregation program, you still have to pay for this on your monthly bill. They are that sneaky.\n\n \nIf we are going to stop Duke from using our paychecks to prop up these old, outdated and dirty coal plants, we need to act now.\n\n\nAttend the final public hearing on Sept 18th and tell the PUCO commissioners you don\u2019t want to pay for Duke\u2019s power plant bail out.\n\n \n** Hearing begins at 12:30, we will meet up at 12pm in front of City Hall and go inside to sign up to speak."}
