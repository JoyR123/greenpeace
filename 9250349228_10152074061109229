She dies guarding her eggs (doesn't eat or sleep all the while that she is looking after them,  and literally collapses just in time to feed them when they emerge).  So they get their first nutrition from her tissues.  A very elegant evolved solution to the problem of getting a quick energy 'fix' to confront the dangerous first weeks of life.    Incredible sacrifice on her part.
