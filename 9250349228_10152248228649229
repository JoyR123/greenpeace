The proposal also sets out compensation for affected fishers.\n\nHowever, there are some missing measures that must be included for this proposal to be fully effective. The most important is to strengthen surveillance and enforcement. Illegal gillnetting in the vaquita habitat is common and must be eliminated. We\u2019re also urging the Mexican government to make this a permanent ban on gillnet fishing.\n\nBy the end of this month the proposal will have passed through consultation and be ready for a final draft. This doesn\u2019t mean the campaign is over, as there may be more campaigning needed. So please stay tuned so that we can keep working for a bright future for the vaquita", "id": "10152248228284229_10152248229014229", "user_likes": false}]}}
