Greenpeace is a campaigning organisation that works on environmental issues and sustainable living. This year, given India's current political and cultural climate, several civil societies are standing up for this cause and we are supporting it. There has never been a similar attempt to crush dissent before, and hence we believe in ensuring that voices of of individuals are heard. We believe in direct campaigning and lobbying, and recent happenings in India are threatening individuals right to freedom of speech. This itself threatens what we do best which is, radical non-violent campaigning to make an impact & cause change. When was the last time, civil society and NGOs were labelled 'anti-national' or a 'threat to development'. By supporting a civil society movement for freedom of rights is not denouncing our environmental work, or taking us towards a political cause or aligning us to any political party, at the end of the day all three are completely inter-linked and you can't have a sustainable and clean environment without a just and democratic political and civil society system.", "id": "10152195755652844_10152195914142844", "user_likes": false}]}}
