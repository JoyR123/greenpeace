Seven more were stranded in nearby municipality of Kashima, according to Igawa.\n\n\u201cWe just have to wait for the inspection results,\u201d he said, adding 70 of the creatures will be locally buried at four sites in accordance with regulations.\n\nRescuers were forced on Friday to abandon efforts to save the creatures after frantic efforts all day.\n\nAs darkness fell, local officials in Hokota said the rescue effort had been called off. The rest of the creatures, usually found in the deep ocean, had either died or were dying, they said.\n\n\u201cIt was becoming dark and too dangerous to continue the rescue work at this beach, where we could not bring heavy equipment,\u201d said an unnamed Hokota municipal official. \u201cMany people volunteered to rescue them but the dolphins became very, very weak.\n\nRead More http://netzfrauen.org/2015/04/20/japan-hat-angst-150-delphine-stranden-vor-ibaraki/\n#Netzfrauen", "id": "10153022888409961_10153023722944961", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2015, 4, 19, 22], "full_picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQBiHeLr-d2zKj9h&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenpeace.org%2Fcanada%2Fcommunity_images%2F87%2F4687%2F111752_183682.jpg", "caption": "greenpeace.org", "edge": "posts", "link": "http://www.greenpeace.org/canada/en/Blogentry/podcastwhen-is-dirty-oil-not-dirty-when-its-c/blog/52324/", "shares": {"count": 40}, "urls": [], "created_time": "2015-04-19T22:30:00+0000", "message": "Last week, thousands came out in Quebec City and said no to tar sands oil and the Energy East pipeline.
