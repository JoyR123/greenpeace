Thousands of people came together to march against deep sea oil drilling in Aotearoa's unspoiled oceans.Together we beat our drums for a clean energy future and we delivered an emphatic message to the oil industry and to the Government: New Zealanders will not tolerate the oil industry's abuse of our land, our oceans and our future.\n\n\"Are you listening John Key? Are you listening Simon Bridges MP? Are you listening Statoil?\"\n\nWe were humbled by the number of people who joined us, and we were inspired by the positive energy you brought with you.\n\nTahi rua toru wh\u0101, waho papa moana!\n\nGood on you Auckland! \n\nVideo thanks to Marcus Palmer."}
