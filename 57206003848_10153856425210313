What a pathetic insult to the very thing that nurtures, sustains, supports and maintains every living thing at every moment. How about Earth HOUR, Earth DAY, Earth WEEK, Earth MONTH or Earth YEAR??!! Instead of constantly TAKING and destroying-just STOP-and maybe give back for more than an hour. This will never happen. Our fucking stupid 'economy'(insatiable greed) can't afford to let up for more than an hour on our mindless 'progress'. My hope is that humans wipe ourselves out soon, and quickly-so this awesome Earth can recover minus us.

We will be doing a little walk around the centre to see which naughty buildings keep their lights on at night. Once we have  a list of naughty's and nice's we will contact each building and give them the Earth Hour challenge! \n\nAre you ready to take part? Come and join us! \n\nMy contact details are: 0799997671 or email the group via Facebook. \n\n http://ehour.me/2014ViD"}
