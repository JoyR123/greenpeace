This way people who volunteer at the garden and passers by can have the opportunity to take a breather and enjoy the shade under the tree. We will do this using repurposed materials only. \n\nWe have chosen to make the structures from old tyres that the garden no longer uses for planting, therefore upcycling a product that would otherwise require collection and landfilling. It is also a great way to showcase what can be done with our waste to turn it into a resource and reduce our waste to landfill. \n\nWe need you to bring:\nSpades, forks, picks, sledge hammer, wheel barrows, saws, grouting and any other tools you think may be handy. \nWaste: Rubble(small bits), top soil, rope, unused hard wood.\n\nBring along:\nDrinks and snacks to keep you going - its hard work! \nSun hat\n\nWear comfy clothes you don't mind getting dirty. \n\nThis will be a great learning opportunity and anyone who has knowledge of \"Earth Building\" - your expertise is greatly appreciated.\n\nLook forward to seeing you all there."}
