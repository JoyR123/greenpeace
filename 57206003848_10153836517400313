Signing this petition draws attention to the very real human costs of coal power, making an excellent case for good, clean, renewable energy.\n \n-- Our electricity shouldn\u2019t cost human lives. But sadly air pollution from Eskom\u2019s coal plants is having massive health impacts that are even affecting children. The technology exists to make coal plants a little cleaner \u2013 signing this petition will push Eskom to use that tech.\n \n-- The communities most affected by Eskom\u2019s pollution, those living right on the doorsteps of coal plants, are often the most vulnerable and least able to influence this process. We can have an influence though, and we can push Eskom to meet the legal standards it\u2019s trying to dodge.\n \nIf you haven\u2019t yet, please sign this petition now.\nWe have less than 48 hours until the deadline. \n\n>> http://bit.ly/1fTv09y", "total": {"new": 18.9655172414, "months": {"1": 20, "2": 38}, "reeng": {"10": 31, "1": 11, "3": 6, "5": 4, "4": 1, "7": 1, "6": 1, "9": 2, "8": 1}, "month": 34.4827586207}, "type": "link", "id": "57206003848_10153836517400313", "description": "Tell the National Air Quality Officer to make sure Eskom complies with pollution legislation."}
