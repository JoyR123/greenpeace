Procter & Gamble have committed to stop trashing the rainforest!\n\nAfter nearly 400,000 of us around the world emailed P&G\u2019s boss and thousands more campaigned in supermarkets, on the streets and on social media - they have listened.\n\nYesterday P&G published this update on their website: \u201cP&G\u2019s new goals call for ensuring no deforestation in its entire palm supply chain.\u201d\n\nThis is huge news for the future of the rainforests and it shows what we can do together. When we can make a company as big as P&G change its ways like this it sends a clear signal to the rest of the industry that destroying the rainforests is bad for business.\n\nWhat next? Share the news! The more people who hear about it, the harder it will be for P&G to even think about going back on their promise.\n\nShare this post!\n\nP&G\u2019s palm oil supply won\u2019t be cleaned up overnight. Our team of investigators who first tracked P&G\u2019s supply of palm oil from the forests of Indonesia to the shopping malls will be watching very closely to see that the company keeps its promises. And if it looks like they\u2019re going to break them, we\u2019ll all be ready to pounce.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes a movement like Greenpeace unique.\n\nTogether we are millions of people around the world who hold companies like P&G to account. We are the hundreds of thousands who sent emails to P&G\u2019s CEO, put stickers on their bottles and called their offices. We are expert investigators watching plantations and studying financial records to uncover evidence companies want to hide. And we are ordinary people willing to take non-violent direct action to protect our incredible planet.\n\nWe can take on the companies and Governments that trash the world\u2019s forests, those that plunder the oceans and threaten the climate. We can take on those that would risk everything by drilling for oil in the Arctic and in the deep seas around New Zealand.\n\nTogether we can do amazing things.\n\nThere\u2019s much to do, but for now let\u2019s share the good news and hold P&G to their word! \n\n------------------------\nSign up to keep protecting forests >> http://wefb.it/7631A4", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"1": 348, "3": 199, "2": 260, "4": 398}, "reeng": {"10": 647, "3": 52, "2": 220, "5": 43, "4": 79, "7": 40, "6": 50, "9": 33, "8": 41}, "month": 28.8796680498}, "type": "photo", "id": "11870725774_10152366286165775", "petition": null, "comments": {"months": {"1": 10, "3": 5, "2": 8, "4": 5}, "reeng": {"10": 15, "3": 2, "2": 8, "7": 1, "6": 1, "9": 1}, "month": 35.7142857143, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "Mjk=", "before": "Mjk="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/11870725774_10152366286165775/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=Mjk%3D"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 29, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "646080622158406", "name": "Nicole Mucalo"}, "like_count": 3, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-04-09T21:29:30+0000", "message": "thank-you everyone who helped with signing", "id": "10152366242600775_13137468", "user_likes": false}]}}
