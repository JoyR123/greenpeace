She has always been my hero but yesterday as she and I marched together with thousands of others through the streets of Baltimore, I have never felt such pride, such love, such awe of this amazing person by my side.  Meghann loves her students and when stories of police brutality and the murder of young Freddie Grey spread, Meghann painted her sign, marched, lead the chants, and owned the streets like a boss!  She was interviewed by two news crews and photographed by many others.  Love for her students drove her on and she marched with all her heart for love, for unity, for social justice, for an end to police brutality, dehumanization and killings, so that one day, her students will march no more.  With tears of pride and deep respect and love in my eyes I write, Meghann Harris, you are one of my greatest heros!", "id": "10153318943074684_10153318983404684", "user_likes": false}]}}
