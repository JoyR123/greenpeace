They\u2019ve been joined along the way by people from the East Cape and Kaikoura who are also under threat from deep sea oil drilling bitly.com/waiho-papa-moana\n\nTomorrow is the chance for Aucklander\u2019s to join this important movement in defence of our oceans by joining the Hikoi at 12 Noon at Britmart for the March up Queen St to the NZ Oil conference at SkyCity.\n\nWill you join us to make our all of our voices heard for a clean energy future? Meet us opposite Britomart tomorrow (Tuesday) at 12 noon -- click here for details: http://bitly.com/hikoi-auckland\n\nStatoil are a Norwegian Oil company who want to do risky deep sea drilling off Northland\u2019s unspoiled coast and plan to carry out seismic testing, which is known to distress whales and dolphins, this summer. They are also one of the companies invading the pristine Arctic to drill for oil AND they are sponsoring the Auckland oil conference. These guys are bad news.\n\nSo tomorrow and throughout the summer we will stand together with coastal communities from across Aotearoa to show Statoil and the oil industry that the fight to stop deep sea oil drilling is as strong as ever.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s and the world\u2019s future is in clean energy not polluting fossil fuels that harm our climate and risk ruining our way of life with oil spills.\n\n>> http://bitly.com/hikoi-auckland <<", "datetime": [2014, 9, 29, 3], "pid": 11870725774, "comments": {"months": {"1": 5, "3": 6, "2": 1, "5": 1, "7": 4, "6": 1, "9": 2, "8": 3}, "reeng": {"9": 4, "10": 13, "3": 1, "2": 2, "1": 3}, "month": 21.7391304348, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MjY=", "before": "MjY="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/10152751088575775/comments?access_token=192154930871376%7CUId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&pretty=0&summary=1&limit=1&after=MjY%3D"}, "new": 13.0434782609, "summary": {"total_count": 26, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "883701871686953", "name": "Jude Collie"}, "like_count": 20, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-09-29T04:21:14+0000", "message": "Yes we may drive cars but that doesn't mean we want our pristine beaches destroyed. Beaches which earn our country millions of tourist dollars every year. Its a financially dubious proposition, and defies our duty to ensure our marine ecology is healthy. Did you know that the vast majority of oxygen on earth is generorated by ocean vegetable plankton? Which we have in great numbers in NZ waters - but not if we kill it all! \n\nThe way forward is to invest in the development of clean technologies which are inevitably going to be the future as oil runs out. Not paying to get oil companies in to destroy our beaches for a doomed industry. Poor business sense. We have already spent millions trying to get companies interested.
