Join us at the rally, bring your family and friends, and demand this destructive forest clearing ends immediately. Here are the essential details: \n\nWhen: 12 noon on Wednesday 4 June 2014\n\nWhere: Governor Phillip Tower, 1 Farrer Place, Sydney (scroll down for a map below)\n\nTransport: Travel by bus or train to Martin Place. Walk north along Phillip Street and turn left at Bent Street.\n\nWhat to bring: Water, warm clothes, and your home-made signs with the slogan \u201cSave The Leard\u201d.\n\nWho can come: Everyone! Bring as many friends and family members as you can.\n\nMeanwhile, we\u2019re forming a human blockade inside the forest which is just managing to hold off the bulldozers before they can cause any more carnage. But this can\u2019t permanently halt the bulldozers. To really stop this latest threat, we need to shame the same politicians who approved this destruction to immediately intervene and call off the clearing.\n\nGuest speakers to be confirmed.
