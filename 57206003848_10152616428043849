We must avoid a rerun if the crop takes off in its native Africa....\r\n\r\nAll is not doom and gloom. Palm oil can be produced in a more sustainable and responsible manner, one which poses a minimal threat to biodiversity, forest and existing livelihoods.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure this happens, no new oil-palm concessions should be awarded until environmentally and socially responsible policies are in place. Failing this, governments should stop any expansion of plantations into areas inhabited by endangered primates and other zones of high biodiversity.\"\r\n\r\nRead the rest of the article here >> http://bit.ly/1aDRr0Y", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"1": 382}, "reeng": {"10": 85, "3": 4, "2": 154, "5": 7, "4": 69, "7": 8, "6": 27, "9": 4, "8": 24}, "month": 100.0}, "type": "photo", "id": "57206003848_10152616428043849", "petition": null, "comments": {"months": {"1": 8}, "reeng": {"10": 4, "2": 2, "4": 1, "6": 1}, "month": 100.0, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "OQ==", "before": "OQ=="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/57206003848_10152616428043849/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=883483195046454|9nfpAUxoDRMZ77lLiQ83CrnaV3s&after=OQ%3D%3D"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 9, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "648038618660170", "name": "Yusuf Mallie"}, "like_count": 5, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-01-21T11:31:08+0000", "message": "This planet is a beautiful gift to be shared amongst inhabitant\nThis planet isn't our laboratory nor it the environment our science experiment\n\nWe are the gardeners of this planet toiling and harvesting a sustainable environment that benefits everything.
