Oil is used is way too many products to count. Where will your boycott stop? Most products you purchase in a supermarket use oil in their manufacturing process in one form or another - especially any item contained in plastic.\n- Lego's collaboration with Shell is limited to promotional items on the store counters with cars, small fire-fighting boats etc. Point me to the oil drilling rig set, please?\n- Only a handful of Lego products have been released featuring the shell logo, and then either in colaboration with Ferrari and racing, or a few early fuel station sets.\n- Why are Greenpeace electing to only now pick on Lego for it's minor involvement with Shell? There were a couple of sets in the 80's that bore the Shell logo.\n- Pop down and do your weekly grocery shop and tell me how well you go with not buying any oil-based products.\n- And with all of this said, I think Lego should end their partnership with Shell because they have done and are doing the wrong thing... but boycotting, misrepresentation and slander are not the answer.", "id": "10152307107057971_10152311541687971", "user_likes": false}]}}
