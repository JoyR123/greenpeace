Why are they being attacked so much when clearly their intentions are good and they are making efforts which has never been done by the other parties before? Everyday they are being buried under politically motivated allegations, when will they work. They are new, they will make honest mistakes..nothing wrong,they will learn. They need our encouragement and support. One man cannot solve everything in one day by waving a magic wand. They are auditing the power companies and the pope companies are harassing the people with power cuts in return. It's going to take time to break this deeply entrenched bully culture. How can anyone expect it to be solved overnight? However if the concerned AAP authorities know about this..I'm sure they'll help. They have shown by action that we can have faith in them. After all they are from among us, and we can be the change.", "id": "10151893255287844_10431149", "user_likes": false}]}}
