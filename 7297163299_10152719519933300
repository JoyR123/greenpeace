You have the power, be a conscience shopper. If you care about our air, water and soil, our environment and species that live within then you can protect all by being a conscience shopper. Only buy products that adher to strong protections, products that don't use pesticides and herbicides which kill pollinators(bees), birds, animals and pollute our ground water, lakes and rivers(ie drinking water). This is why buying organic food does so much more then provide nutritious food. Buy clothing that is non toxic, and natural fibers like organic linen, organic hemp,organic cotton, organic wool, etc... When you purchase clothing that doesn't require toxins, heavy metals and chemicals, pesticides, herbicides, etc you protect your body as well as the air, water, soil, environment and species within it. Energy, roof top solar energy is another great way to protect our air,water,soil,,environment and species within it. Transportation, walk,bike,drive an electric car, car pool. When we reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, we protect the Arctic! As you can see, when we use our power to become conscience shoppers we make a world of difference, faster then any law or bill waiting to be passed, because you have the power to make instant change. Every small amount adds up quickly. You have the power to make instant change which is positive and peaceful.", "id": "10152719518623300_10152719533548300", "user_likes": false}]}}
