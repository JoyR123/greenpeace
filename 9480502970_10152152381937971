Here\u2019s the Rainbow Eucalyptus, a tree that looks like a toddler has been set loose in the forest with some tins of paint and no responsible adult keeping an eye on them.\n\nRemarkably, this tree\u2019s colouring is entirely natural. As the Rainbow Eucalyptus grows the bark falls away in patches at different times of year exposing the bright green inner bark. As time passes the inner back changes colour going blue, purple, orange and then maroon, giving the trees their incredibly colourful look.\n\nThese trees are naturally found in the rainforests of the Philippines, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea but they are also used in pulp-wood plantations for making paper. These rainforests are under threat from deforestation to create these plantations but that doesn\u2019t make these trees any less spectacular to look at.\n\nWhat an incredible reminder of why we all need to stand together for our forests and the incredible diversity of life they contain.", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"1": 7975, "3": 779, "2": 1274, "4": 1291}, "reeng": {"10": 2595, "3": 93, "2": 7245, "5": 80, "4": 638, "7": 69, "6": 324, "9": 65, "8": 210}, "month": 70.4567541302}, "type": "photo", "id": "9480502970_10152152381937971", "petition": null, "comments": {"months": {"1": 718, "3": 45, "2": 73, "4": 59}, "reeng": {"10": 126, "3": 4, "2": 685, "5": 4, "4": 30, "7": 3, "6": 19, "9": 3, "8": 21}, "month": 80.2234636872, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "OTIx", "before": "OTIx"}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/9480502970_10152152381937971/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=883483195046454|9nfpAUxoDRMZ77lLiQ83CrnaV3s&after=OTIx"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 921, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "706433426145759", "name": "Deidre Kingc"}, "like_count": 52, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-04-30T10:59:59+0000", "message": "why would anyone want to cut down these beautiful and interesting trees, TO MAKE PAPER.
