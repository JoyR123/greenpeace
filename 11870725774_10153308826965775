The bombing of the Rainbow Warrior was a powerful defining moment in NZ's social history.  This complex tragedy had a huge impact on myself, as a student at Auckland Uni, Elam School of Fine Arts. That 1984 bombing prompted me to spend the next 30 years making art - as spiritual / social / political commentary. Even though I have not lived in NZ for 25 years, the legacy of the Rainbow Warrior story still resonates deeply with me, so I commend all the people involved in supporting this theatre piece into fruition.", "id": "10153308826965775_10153308969000775", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2015, 5, 20, 1], "full_picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQBW-sEMZQEU90UD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.nzherald.co.nz%2Fwebcontent%2Fimage%2Fjpg%2F201521%2Frainbow-warrior-sunk-by-two-u_1024x761.jpg", "caption": "nzherald.co.nz", "edge": "posts", "link": "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/element-magazine/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503340&objectid=11451737", "shares": {"count": 71}, "urls": [], "created_time": "2015-05-20T01:56:12+0000", "message": "Opening tonight", "total": {"new": 2.3529411765, "months": {"11": 13, "10": 20, "12": 132, "1": 35, "3": 24, "2": 19, "5": 15, "4": 22, "7": 11, "6": 19, "9": 14, "8": 16}, "reeng": {"10": 290, "1": 8, "3": 7, "2": 9, "5": 7, "4": 4, "7": 3, "6": 4, "9": 2, "8": 6}, "month": 10.2941176471}, "type": "link", "id": "11870725774_10153308826965775", "description": "The Large Group and Last Tapes Theatre Company have joined together to produce Fallout: The Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior in commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the bombing - New Zealand Herald"}
