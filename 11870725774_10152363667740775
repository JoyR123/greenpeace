Pando is a clonal-colony of around 47,000 genetically identical quaking aspen stems that covers 43 hectares (106 acres), weighs roughly 6,600 tons and is an estimated 80,000 years old!\n\nTo put this into context, when Pando\u2019s seed first sprouted, modern humans had barely set foot out of Africa.\n\nScientists have suggested Pando and other quaking aspen colonies in Fish Lake National Park, Utah, could be up to a million years old! This would mean they predate the earliest homo sapiens by 800,000 years!\n\nTrees are awesome.
