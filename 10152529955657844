That it is humanly impossible to restore it.\n\nAs the surroundings of the Colibri geoglyph are also part of the archaeological site, any intervention without protection affects the whole. The pebbles at the surface of the Nazca desert contain 'ferrous oxide and its exposure of 'Centuries' has given them a dark patina' \n( http://www.crystalinks.com/nazca.html ) \nSo, when the activists stepped on it without shoe protection,  they left their footprints on the ground. \n\nIn order for me, an Anthropologist, to accept your apologies/excuses, you need to aknowledge 'the extensive damage caused' in the site, not only referring to it as a mere \"offence\" caused by the activity. This statement IS offensive per se. \n\nPhotographies in the web, clearly show the white lines added by the activists, from the space between the beak and the wing of the Hummingbird geoglyph .\nYou can check the proper explanation in the video of the president de la Asociaci\u00f3n Mar\u00eda Reiche: Se\u00f1ora Ana Mar\u00eda Cogorno, about the damage. Also in the interview with the archaeologist and teacher Krzystof Makowski. ( http://puntoedu.pucp.edu.pe/noticias/el-caso-greenpeace-y-el-problema-de-la-proteccion-del-patrimonio/  )\n\nI'm mystified by some of the remarks I have read in the facebook page of your NGO. They completely ignore the damage done by your intervention. By adding new lines to the geoglyph, the activists modified for the worst, what's considered to be an emblema, a symbol, an archetypal image, not only to Peruvians but also to the world. This lack of attention not only hurt people but also damaged shamanic traditions, to cite an example.\nHave you ever considered that? \n\nHave you ever considered that placing the logo of an organization in the sacred mountains of Machu Pichu, the Temple of the Sun, is not only affecting people who go there as tourists but also to pray, to be in communion with Nature and so on?\n\nThis environmental NGO is interfering with the archetypes of many tropical cultural settings because now, the photos are everywhere in the Internet and it's impossible to erase them.\n\nSome of your posts boast about your \"43 years of experience\". Whose experience, I ask you? The organization is 43 years old but most of the activists in the Nazca event had not been working for that long. How old are you? How old is Mauro Fern\u00e1ndez? \n\nWhat was done in the geoglyph of Colibri, intelectually denotes a complete lack of knowledge and expertise in dealing with archaeological and cultural sites. The Greenpeace I knew in my youth would NEVER commit this gross mistake! What happened in Nazca was the result of an amateuristic job and thirst for publicity.\n\nTo end this message, I would like to point out that thanks to your actions, the real reason for your protests is being completely ignored. Have you noticed that? Another good example was the Russia event. I asked many people if they remembered what the activists were protesting against when they were arrested in Russia. Guess what? No one could remember the  reason. Not a single soul.  All they remembered was that the activists were arrested and the world was paying attention to the campaign for their release.\n\nYou, as the President of this NGO, should start thinking about this. Maybe it is time to reevaluate the NGO's motivations, train your staff a little better and take a good look at who or what corporation is giving you support and why.\n\nAnyway, thank you for your message, although I had already visited all the links you had sent. \n\nI do hope your organization takes responsibility for the irreversible damage done to the Hummingbird geoglyph in Nazca. If, during my youth when I was a student at university, someone had told me this was going to happen to Nazca, I would never believe them.
