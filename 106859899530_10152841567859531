For me it was a testament to the idea that asking nicely can get you places, it was also a chance to combine my 2 passions \u2013 sailing and caring for our planet.\nI didn\u2019t have to think twice. Two days later, I was hopping off the gangway and onto the deck of the Rainbow Warrior. \n\nFrom the outset, I was really impressed by how kind everyone on board was. A mix of people, Greenpeace professional crew, some from Greenpeace Africa, and of course the Greenpeace Africa volunteers.\nI became involved with life on board and helped where I could \u2013 an absolute pleasure on such a wonderful vessel. At break times and after work in the evening, we sat around and talked and I listened to stories from some of the crew members. I realised that these people are the real Rainbow Warriors \u2013 many of them have been beaten, arrested and locked up. These are the people who are prepared to put their lives on the line for what they believe in.\n\nThen also, the young and enthusiastic volunteers \u2013 many of whom were really seasick, but still continued with their tasks as and when they could. They are actively involved in Greenpeace activities in their home towns. Arriving in Durban, I met more volunteers \u2013 also enthusiastic in their support of and work for the Greenpeace cause.\n\nMaybe this trip was meant to be, to show me that there is so much more I can do to help and promote Greenpeace causes and campaigns. I don\u2019t think I have enough courage to be a real warrior and confront trains or land on oil rigs and get beaten up or arrested, but certainly I can do more than just throw money at it.\n\nWhen I got home, I signed up as a volunteer on the Greenpeace Africa site. I am looking forward to doing something more to further to Greenpeace cause and working alongside some of the wonderful people I met.\" - Estelle Langenhoven", "total": {"new": 6.7796610169, "months": {"11": 21, "10": 24, "12": 43, "1": 25, "3": 34, "2": 37, "5": 14, "4": 21, "7": 19, "6": 18, "9": 20, "8": 19}, "reeng": {"10": 234, "1": 20, "3": 6, "2": 5, "5": 4, "4": 6, "7": 7, "6": 7, "9": 2, "8": 4}, "month": 8.4745762712}, "type": "photo", "id": "106859899530_10152841567859531", "petition": null, "comments": {"months": {"9": 1, "1": 1, "12": 1, "7": 1}, "reeng": {"1": 1, "10": 3}, "month": 25.0, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "NA==", "before": "NA=="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/106859899530_10152841567859531/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=883483195046454|9nfpAUxoDRMZ77lLiQ83CrnaV3s&after=NA%3D%3D"}, "new": 25.0, "summary": {"total_count": 4, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "391937321013709", "name": "Raphael C Farquhar"}, "like_count": 5, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2015-03-08T08:21:50+0000", "message": "Pedant's Corner over here, but it's your 7th decade as you head into your 60's.
