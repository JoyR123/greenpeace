The interviewer then told him that he was going to have to change his answers for him into \"agree\" if he wanted to get the $75!! My husband obviously said no and that was the end of the conversation. Next thing you know we'll be seeing a \"poll\" done by an \"independent company\" on how Vancouverites agree with the pipeline!
