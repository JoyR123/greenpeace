"The remaining fields record the date supporters completed an online action (a petition, a letter to politician, or a sign up form). These actions can be categorized by campaign for the main event if this makes sense to do. For each transaction, EN records the date as something like :::P:DD/MM/YYY. There may be more than one participation date in a field if the supporter has taken the same action twice.",
