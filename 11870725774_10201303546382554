Big Oil has gotta be thinking deep sea drilling in Aotearoa is going to be more trouble than it's worth.\n\nBut we need to keep the pressure on so let's get the banners up for the entire summer!\n\nIf you've still got your banner - put it up. If not make a sign and put it up at your place. Put it on your fence, on your neighbour\u2019s fence, on your uncle\u2019s farm up SH1, at your favourite beach, at your school, at the dairy, on your roof, on that blank wall in the high street or \u2026 you get the picture, we're talking EVERYWHERE!\n\n(Please be neighbourly and ask before you put your signs up if it\u2019s not on your property.)\n\nAnd then get a photo - ideally a selfie with your sign - and post it here for everyone to see!\n\nYou will need:\n\n- Creativity\n- Sign making materials (Paints, pens, corflute cardboard, an old bit of ply, canvas, fabric, sheet or shade cloth)\n- And a sense of adventure for those of you getting visible in places further afield than your fence!\n\nWhen:\nStarting NOW and carrying on through Summer and beyond, until we Stop. Deep. Sea. Oil!  if you\u2019ve only got time to do one thing to stop deep sea oil before the year is out - then do this!\n\nWe cannot leave any beach un-bannered, any shop un-signed, any fence un-flagged.\n\nSo get out there and get seen, have fun, good luck, and please post your image here for everyone to see and get inspired.\n\nIf you\u2019ve put your signs up and want to do more go to http://www.getfree.org.nz/get-active-and-get-free/  for some action inspiration."}
