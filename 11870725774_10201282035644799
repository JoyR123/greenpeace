The MV Duke is currently in Port in Wellington.\n\nOne Oil Free Wellington member boarded the vessel in order to issue the notice to the captain directly.\n\n\u201cThis tresspass notice was issued by the Wellingtonians who marched against deep sea oil drilling two weeks ago. It demands Anadarko leaves our oceans for the sake of our coasts, climate and communities.\u201d says Oil Free Wellington spokesperson James Barber\n\n\u201cOn the day we marched to Anadarko\u2019s offices to issue this tresspass notice they had closed their offices in response. That left us with no other choice but to visit the seismic surveying ship to deliver this message.\u201d\n\u201cUpon receiving the tresspass notice the captain said \u2018we won\u2019t find oil.\u201d\n\n \u201cWellingtonians are extremely concerned about the impact of deep sea oil drilling on the coasts, the climate and marine life. Anadarko are not welcome in Wellington,\u201d says Barber.\n\n \u201cResistance to Anadarko and deep sea drilling plans is growing. Oil Free Otago\u2019s flotilla last weekend shows the movement around Aotearoa is prepared to resist these plans every step of the way.\u201d\n\nENDS", "pid": 11870725774, "comments": {"months": {"1": 1, "2": 7}, "reeng": {"1": 1, "8": 1, "5": 1, "4": 1, "10": 4}, "month": 12.5, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTE=", "before": "MTE="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/11870725774_10201282035644799/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=MTE%3D"}, "new": 12.5, "summary": {"total_count": 11, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "10153282769498320", "name": "Carolyn MagiThoth"}, "like_count": 4, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-02-12T02:42:13+0000", "message": "Yessss! =D", "id": "10201282035644799_5120781", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2014, 2, 12, 2], "edge": "posts", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/OilFreeWellington/posts/596026263812708", "likes": {"months": {"1": 27, "2": 138}, "reeng": {"10": 101, "1": 14, "3": 11, "2": 3, "5": 6, "4": 12, "7": 3, "6": 6, "9": 5, "8": 4}, "month": 16.3636363636, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxNTMzNDQ2NjY3MDA3ODY=", "before": "MTAxNTMzNDQ2NjY3MDA3ODY="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/11870725774_10201282035644799/likes?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=MTAxNTMzNDQ2NjY3MDA3ODY%3D"}, "new": 8.4848484848, "summary": {"total_count": 169}, "data": [{"id": "10153344666700786", "name": "Kim Cleave"}]}, "urls": [], "created_time": "2014-02-12T02:39:34+0000", "total": {"new": 8.4848484848, "months": {"1": 27, "2": 138}, "reeng": {"10": 101, "1": 14, "3": 11, "2": 3, "5": 6, "4": 12, "7": 3, "6": 6, "9": 5, "8": 4}, "month": 16.3636363636}, "type": "link", "id": "11870725774_10201282035644799", "name": "Oil Free Wellington"}
