We remain deeply grateful to him for defending the #Arctic30 in November.\n\nIn 1973, Greenpeace ship captain Pete Wilcox started sailing for the environment on the Clearwater, the boat started by Pete Seeger.\n\n\"When Seeger was learning to sail in the early 60s, he would bring his boat down to our house, and get lessons from my father. I became captain of the Clearwater in 1976, and stayed for four and a half seasons. Since 1981, I guess about 90% of my life has been skippering Greenpeace boats.\u201d\n\nLet's build on his legacy - participation is needed, now more than ever \n>> http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/take-action/subscribe/\n\n#inspiration via Greenpeace UK", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"1": 550}, "reeng": {"10": 227, "3": 31, "2": 117, "5": 22, "4": 52, "7": 21, "6": 36, "9": 19, "8": 25}, "month": 100.0}, "type": "photo", "id": "11870725774_10152224820850775", "petition": null, "comments": {"months": {"1": 12}, "reeng": {"10": 2, "3": 1, "2": 7, "4": 1, "6": 1}, "month": 100.0, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTI=", "before": "MTI="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/11870725774_10152224820850775/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=MTI%3D"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 12, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "869059279826146", "name": "Maria Munoz"}, "like_count": 2, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-01-30T09:35:48+0000", "message": "this is brilliant... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czk2hj4VISg", "id": "10152224583865775_12607215", "user_likes": false}]}}
