Do your research. I had a perfect companion for 15 years in the little Maltese that I was blessed with from a breeder. She has air conditioned building with full vet facility and regular home vet checks for her dogs. They have their own runs and daily human companionship/interaction. There aren't better socialized/cared for animals for breeding anywhere. If you're going to breed animals and aren't able to do so in your own home, this is the way to do it. But on the other side of the issue, I have seen a puppy mill. The dogs were in rusted wire cages not fit for anything to live in, with feces matted into their fur, flies everywhere, filth everywhere, sick and terrible looking animals.
