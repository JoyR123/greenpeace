It was the largest environmental protest ever in Quebec City and one of the largest climate rallies in Canada's history. \n\nWe told premiers one simple thing: they cannot act on climate while approving tar sands pipelines. We want climate protection and clean energy solutions, now.  \n\nThe day was emotional, beautiful, powerful. This is what 25,000 people for climate solutions looks like."}
