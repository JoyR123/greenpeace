Due to destructive fishing and lack of oversight, there are only 100 of these marine mammals left. Experts estimate that if steps aren\u2019t taken to protect them, they could be completely wiped out in just three years!\n\nFor decades, the scientific community has called on Mexico\u2019s government to address the main threat to the vaquita: accidental capture in fishing nets. Unfortunately, definitive measures have never been taken to halt the disappearance of this unique species.\n\nBUT, after receiving pressure from more than 370,000 people worldwide, the Mexican government has proposed a way forward.\n\nAn agreement that would ban the fishing activities that threaten the vaquita's survival in 5000 square kilometers at its habitat for two years. Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, has yet to make it official but his would be a first and crucial step for saving the vaquita. \n\nIncreased pressure now is more important than ever:\n>>https://secure.greenpeace.org.nz/save-the-vaquita/ \n\nSign and share!", "datetime": [2015, 2, 17, 19], "pid": 11870725774, "comments": {"months": {"11": 1, "10": 1, "12": 2, "1": 6, "3": 1, "5": 1, "4": 1, "7": 1, "9": 1}, "reeng": {"1": 5, "10": 9, "3": 1}, "month": 40.0, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTU=", "before": "MTU="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/10153095174160775/comments?access_token=192154930871376%7CUId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&pretty=0&summary=1&limit=1&after=MTU%3D"}, "new": 33.3333333333, "summary": {"total_count": 15, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "10153064229991348", "name": "Holly Adams"}, "like_count": 1, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2015-02-17T21:04:19+0000", "message": "Wont let me sign for some reason", "id": "10153095174160775_10153095398025775", "user_likes": false}]}, "height": 480, "created_time": "2015-02-17T19:59:28+0000", "width": 720, "edge": "objects", "likes": {"months": {"11": 32, "10": 21, "12": 137, "1": 60, "3": 23, "2": 37, "5": 35, "4": 51, "7": 24, "6": 25, "9": 25, "8": 31}, "reeng": {"10": 405, "1": 29, "3": 13, "2": 5, "5": 13, "4": 6, "7": 6, "6": 11, "9": 6, "8": 7}, "month": 11.9760479042, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "NDQzOTI0ODA1NzU2NDEx", "before": "NDQzOTI0ODA1NzU2NDEx"}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/10153095174160775/likes?access_token=192154930871376%7CUId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&pretty=0&summary=1&limit=1&after=NDQzOTI0ODA1NzU2NDEx"}, "new": 5.7884231537, "summary": {"total_count": 510}, "data": [{"id": "443924805756411", "name": "Blake Walker"}]}, "urls": [{"components": {"fragment": "", "netloc": "secure.greenpeace.org.nz", "params": "", "query": {}, "path": ["save-the-vaquita"], "scheme": "https"}, "url": "https://secure.greenpeace.org.nz/save-the-vaquita/", "driver": null, "ea": {"ea.campaign.id": null, "ea.client.id": null}, "redir": {"service": null, "url": "https://secure.greenpeace.org.nz/save-the-vaquita/", "surl": null, "key": "399483437034dd7a763f6753393704d0", "aurora": false, "history": []}, "landing": "https://secure.greenpeace.org.nz/save-the-vaquita/", "key": "399483437034dd7a763f6753393704d0", "petition": {"cc": "NZ", "basket": "oceans", "issue": "vaquita"}}], "images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10995993_10153095174160775_4111139018741366618_n.jpg?oh=f2d343b7833e29ce0f9120d6342be3df&oe=55C7F23F", "height": 534, "width": 800}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p480x480/10995993_10153095174160775_4111139018741366618_n.jpg?oh=343aad8688dad6670f5c6d3bfd5d32b6&oe=5605EE35", "height": 480, "width": 719}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p320x320/10995993_10153095174160775_4111139018741366618_n.jpg?oh=df09d87325f1925d257790f9aa58e387&oe=56010C77", "height": 320, "width": 479}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p130x130/10995993_10153095174160775_4111139018741366618_n.jpg?oh=7da21ac2001402a46fafb4f95ee93faa&oe=55F6E867", "height": 130, "width": 194}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p75x225/10995993_10153095174160775_4111139018741366618_n.jpg?oh=bef2139c95d76bd66d5f1b3427ab01de&oe=56053319", "height": 225, "width": 337}], "total": {"new": 6.4453125, "months": {"11": 33, "10": 22, "12": 138, "1": 65, "3": 23, "2": 37, "5": 36, "4": 51, "7": 25, "6": 25, "9": 26, "8": 31}, "reeng": {"10": 411, "1": 33, "3": 14, "2": 5, "5": 13, "4": 6, "7": 6, "6": 11, "9": 6, "8": 7}, "month": 12.6953125}, "id": "10153095174160775"}
