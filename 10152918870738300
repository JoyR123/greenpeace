January was the driest in California since record-keeping began in 1895. Groundwater and snowpack levels are at all-time lows. We\u2019re not just up a creek without a paddle in California, we\u2019re losing the creek too.\n\nData from NASA satellites show that the total amount of water stored in the Sacramento and San Joaquin river basins \u2014 that is, all of the snow, river and reservoir water, water in soils and groundwater combined \u2014 was 34 million acre-feet below normal in 2014. That loss is nearly 1.5 times the capacity of Lake Mead, America\u2019s largest reservoir.\n\nStatewide, we\u2019ve been dropping more than 12 million acre-feet of total water yearly since 2011. Roughly two-thirds of these losses are attributable to groundwater pumping for agricultural irrigation in the Central Valley. Farmers have little choice but to pump more groundwater during droughts, especially when their surface water allocations have been slashed 80% to 100%. But these pumping rates are excessive and unsustainable. Wells are running dry. In some areas of the Central Valley, the land is sinking by one foot or more per year.\nRead More:
