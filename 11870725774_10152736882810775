Please pass on links and keep building awareness on this issue and make the changes in your lives to take us to the place we need to be.\n\nThis is one significant step along the way. We've been told that Statoil has only ever had one protest against them, so yesterday's was the second and largest ever. This will be beamed into the Norwegian public during this week and we hope it makes all the difference!\n\nThank you all again e tatou ma,\nFrom the Hikoi Whanau\n---------------------\nTuesday:\nJOIN US AND JOIN UP WITH THE HIKOI OPPOSITE BRITOMART TODAY @ 12 NOON.\n\nTHEN WE'LL WANDER UP QUEEN STREET TO SKY CITY WHERE THE INTERNATIONAL OIL INDUSTRY CONFERENCE IS BEING HELD, SPONSORED BY STATOIL AND THE KIWI TAXPAYER. BRING SIGNS, BE FUNKY!\n----------------------------------------------------\nHikoi with us from Cape Reinga to Auckland Oil Conference!\n\nPeople from different tribal areas along the western length of Northland are organising the Waiho Papa Moana hikoi to a Government oil conference in Auckland to make sure that Norwegian oil giant Statoil gets the message: Go Home!\n\nAnybody is welcome to join us at any stage.\n\nEverybody along the coast is pulling together to stop Statoil. It is our duty as kaitiaki to make sure there is no seismic testing and no deep sea oil drilling. Generations before us protected this place for the time when we were born and now it\u2019s our time for us all to step up, said Mike Smith, a kaitiaki of Ngapuhi. \u201cYou don\u2019t get a second chance\u201d.\n\nRepresentatives from Te Whanau-a-Apanui and Ngati Kuri of Kaikoura who have fought oil drilling in their areas will join us. There will be plenty of korero about their experiences and the threats here.\n\n\u201cStatoil should have got the message when they were last in Kaitaia that their deep sea oil drilling is not welcome,\u201d said Rueben Taipari Porter a kaitiaki of Te Rarawa. \u201cIt was disgusting to find out that they are now sponsoring the government oil conference in Auckland. They obviously haven\u2019t been listening. Maori don\u2019t want Statoil and their deep sea oil drilling\u201d.\n\n\u201cDead whales have washed up on our beaches recently and we don\u2019t want any more from the seismic testing Statoil says they will start in December,\" he said. \"We see those dead whales as a sign, a warning of what\u2019s to come for life in the sea and the people, if they start.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of the money Statoil makes goes into the pension fund in Norway. It shocks us to think that Norwegian people would put this beautiful sea that we catch our food from, beaches that our children grow up on, at risk. For what? More money? We have been here since our ancestors navigated across the Pacific Ocean a long time ago. We welcome Norwegian people here as friends, but not Statoil,\u201d said Mr Taipari Porter.\n\n\u201cWhen this hikoi hits Auckland on Tuesday 30 September, we hope people who care about this kaupapa will join us during their lunchtimes to hikoi from Britomart to Sky City where the Oil Conference is being held\u201d, he said.\n\nOil Free Auckland is mobilising Aucklanders to join the hikoi at Britomart on Tuesday as it makes the final approach to the oil conference at Skycity: http://bitly.com/hikoi-auckland"}
