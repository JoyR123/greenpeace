In his time here he's taken on seal hunters in Newfoundland, whaling ships in Japan and tuna poachers in the South Pacific. Once, to protest against American nuclear policy, he swam directly into the path of a 3,000-tonne navy destroyer, coming so close he dragged his hand along the hull. He later joked that he felt \"like a matador\".\n\n82 year old Anne Power is as formidable as her name suggests. A figurehead for the anti-fracking protest camp at Barton Moss, Anne travelled to the camp most days through winter. And, with the help of her walking stick, she helped set up blockades, provide food and counselling, and raise awareness.\n\nHit LIKE and join us in thanking Anne and Pete for all that they do.", "datetime": [2014, 6, 12, 15], "pid": 9250349228, "comments": {"months": {"1": 12, "3": 11, "2": 5, "5": 15, "4": 7, "6": 24}, "reeng": {"10": 55, "1": 6, "3": 2, "2": 2, "5": 2, "4": 2, "6": 2, "9": 1, "8": 2}, "month": 16.2162162162, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "NzU=", "before": "NzU="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/10151856814669229/comments?access_token=192154930871376%7CUId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&pretty=0&summary=1&limit=1&after=NzU%3D"}, "new": 8.1081081081, "summary": {"total_count": 75, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "10155590664230346", "name": "Matt Taylor"}, "like_count": 17, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-06-12T15:57:44+0000", "message": "Anne Power is a legend. :-)", "id": "10151856814669229_10151856816834229", "user_likes": false}]}, "height": 514, "created_time": "2014-06-12T15:56:37+0000", "width": 720, "edge": "objects", "likes": {"months": {"1": 386, "3": 340, "2": 352, "5": 294, "4": 337, "6": 664}, "reeng": {"10": 1668, "1": 245, "3": 116, "2": 35, "5": 83, "4": 32, "7": 70, "6": 40, "9": 54, "8": 30}, "month": 16.2663295407, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxMjExNzk3MjE1NDQ0OQ==", "before": "MTAxMjExNzk3MjE1NDQ0OQ=="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/10151856814669229/likes?access_token=192154930871376%7CUId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&pretty=0&summary=1&limit=1&after=MTAxMjExNzk3MjE1NDQ0OQ%3D%3D"}, "new": 10.3244837758, "summary": {"total_count": 2426}, "data": [{"id": "1012117972154449", "name": "Mary Longden"}]}, "urls": [], "images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t31.0-8/1025367_10151856814669229_9138748596763997592_o.jpg", "height": 715, "width": 1000}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t31.0-8/p600x600/1025367_10151856814669229_9138748596763997592_o.jpg", "height": 600, "width": 839}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t31.0-8/p480x480/1025367_10151856814669229_9138748596763997592_o.jpg", "height": 480, "width": 671}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p320x320/10428039_10151856814669229_9138748596763997592_n.jpg?oh=74fac5bcf5b193377e72d96bd764ee0d&oe=55C4EFDD", "height": 320, "width": 447}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t31.0-8/p180x540/1025367_10151856814669229_9138748596763997592_o.jpg", "height": 540, "width": 755}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p130x130/10428039_10151856814669229_9138748596763997592_n.jpg?oh=f618ca5a3ec46ab4431a763acde6e562&oe=55C474CD", "height": 130, "width": 181}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p75x225/10428039_10151856814669229_9138748596763997592_n.jpg?oh=5acdc788f36321450bddbc4321cd81b4&oe=55F4A4B3", "height": 225, "width": 314}], "total": {"new": 10.3765690377, "months": {"1": 392, "3": 342, "2": 353, "5": 297, "4": 338, "6": 668}, "reeng": {"10": 1678, "1": 248, "3": 117, "2": 36, "5": 83, "4": 32, "7": 70, "6": 40, "9": 54, "8": 32}, "month": 16.4016736402}, "id": "10151856814669229"}
