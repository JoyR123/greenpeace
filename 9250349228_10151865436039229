We grew up without central heating; we wore woollens (good for sheep farmers). We made clothes where possible and didn't throw them away till they were worn out or outgrown. We didn't go on foreign holidays (not till I was grown up) or fly anywhere, and we didn't have mobile phones, we wrote letters. We ate local seasonal produce and survived childhood diseases with improved immune systems. We read books and played games and actually talked to each other in the evenings. We walked and cycled locally and walked to school. The world could run perfectly well on much less consumption and waste. The only people who would hurt are the 1% who own all the money, because they can't eat, wear or live in it. We need a new Economy of Enough, not of Growth.
