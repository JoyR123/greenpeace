More specifically, she is the most amazing cat on the planet. Discovered as the runt of a healthy feral litter in a tool shed in rural Indiana, she was taken in as a rescue when it was clear that she would require special care. BUB was born with a multitude of genetic anomalies which all add up to one of nature\u2019s happiest accidents.  \nShe is a \u201cperma-kitten\u201d, which means she will stay kitten sized and maintain kitten-like features her entire life. She also has an extreme case of dwarfism, which means her limbs are disproportionately small relative to the rest of her body and she has some difficulty moving around. She has very short, stubby legs and a weird, long, serpent-like body. Her lower jaw is significantly shorter than her upper jaw, and her teeth never grew in which is why her tongue is always hanging around. Don\u2019t worry, BUB has a very healthy appetite and eats dry and wet food with no problems. Additionally, BUB is a polydactyl cat, meaning she has extra toes, and in her case, one extra toe on all of her four paws. Her front paws each have two opposable thumbs. And then of course there are her big, bulging, wonder-filled green eyes. Some think she can see into the future with those things. Despite her weird looks and numerous \u201cdeformities\u201d, BUB is a healthy, happy cat living in the care of her \u201cdude\u201d who treats her like a queen. \nShe is unlike any other cat in so many ways that some believe that she might actually be from outer space. Beyond her unique looks, she has a remarkable demeanor and attitude that is unlike any other cat. BUB is always full of wonder, always calm and oddly comfortable and at peace in just about any situation. She loves to travel, and sits on her dude\u2019s lap in cabs, subways, planes and even his shoulder as he walks around outside. Her dude owns 4 other wonderful adopted cats, but would never dream of even taking them for a car ride, as they would lose their minds. But BUB, she\u2019s used to space travel, so planes are no big deal.\nBeyond being overwhelmingly cute, exceptionally smart and painfully witty, BUB is an advocate for homeless and special needs pets all over the universe. Since before she was a star she has made it a point to spread a message of positivity. She proves that being different is better  and she encourages the adoption of pets and helping those less fortunate. To date Lil BUB has directly raised more than $60,000 for various charities through her online store and meet-and-greets at animal shelters all of the country while spreading awareness about the importance of adoption, and spaying and neutering your pets.\"", "id": "10152373928723300_10152374229363300", "user_likes": false}]}}
