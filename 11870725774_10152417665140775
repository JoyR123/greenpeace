This meeting pre-empts the vital stages before it; asking and correctly educating the Dunedin community what type of energy expansion options and economic opportunities there are in our neighbourhood. Oil Free Otago demands this base-assumption; that oil and gas is the only exploration option, is put under the spotlight.\n\n\u201cAt no point were Dunedinites asked if this is the direction that we want to see our energy development to go\u201d asks Oil Free Otago spokesperson Danielle Trilford. \u201cRather than asking the initial, primary and basic questions to help shape energy expansion paths, Dunedinites were only allowed to hear about the already set-in-place regulations for exploration and production of oil and gas.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives from New Zealand Petroleum and Minerals, Environmental Protection Authority, Maritime New Zealand, WorkSafe New Zealand, Ministry for the Environment, the Department of Conservation and the Otago Regional Council were in attendance. Critical questions came from the Head of Finance and Business at the University of Otago, Professor Colin Campbell Hunt, who asked \u2018Who bears the financial cost of an incident?\u2019. Other questions included challenges about the upcoming 2014 block offers, where more of New Zealand's land and sea than ever before will be opened up for exploration by global fossil fuel companies.\n\n\u201cWhen will these local and nationwide authorities address the blatant urgency to stop fossil fuel expansion, and move to future-proofed and economically-stronger clean energy options?\u201d asked Oil Free Otago spokesperson Danielle Trilford.\n\n\u201cThis is not about current oil and gas extraction in New Zealand, nor is it about the use of fossil fuels - this is about the expansion of these last centuries industries.\u201d said Ms Trilford.\n\n\u201cNew Zealanders deserve the democratic right to know that they have options for energy expansion, rather than have the regulations of a pre-decided expansion regime shoved down their throats.\u201d explained Oil Free Otago Spokesperson Danielle Trilford.\n\nSix government agencies, together with regional and district councils, share the responsibility for managing petroleum and mineral activities in New Zealand.\n\n\u201cConsidering the oil and gas exploration regime is served to the Otago community without the chance of weighing up the types of options we have, does the public really believe they'll have a say in the remaining fine-grained regulations around it? This is nothing more than a PR stunt so they can tick a box to say they\u2019re \u201cengaging with all stakeholders\u201d\u201d says Oil Free Otago spokesperson Danielle Trilford.\n\n--END", "pid": 11870725774, "comments": {"months": {"5": 1, "4": 1}, "reeng": {"10": 2}, "month": 0.0, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "Mg==", "before": "Mg=="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/11870725774_10152417665140775/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=Mg%3D%3D"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 2, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "895460727178350", "name": "Wade Doak"}, "like_count": 1, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-05-01T22:22:09+0000", "message": "MORE FOSSIL FUEL?\n\nHave we reached the tipping point?\n\nOCEAN ACIDIFICATION : GEN X:\n\nNaia Doak, aged 12', was given excellent for this project, placed in top five out of 180 entries at her Mahurangi  College.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/jICs5D9jSzw\n\nFirst evidence in sea shells:\n\nhttp://research.noaa.gov/News/NewsArchive/LatestNews/TabId/684/ArtMID/1768/ArticleID/10551/NOAA-led-researchers-discover-ocean-acidity-is-dissolving-shells-of-tiny-snails-off-West-Coast.aspx", "id": "10152417665140775_10152417726615775", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2014, 5, 1, 21], "edge": "posts", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/OilFreeOtago/posts/469096939888182", "likes": {"months": {"1": 1, "3": 13, "2": 17, "5": 34, "4": 12}, "reeng": {"10": 69, "3": 1, "2": 1, "7": 1, "6": 3, "9": 1, "8": 1}, "month": 1.2987012987, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAyMDQxNDY5NTEwMjQ4NzM=", "before": "MTAyMDQxNDY5NTEwMjQ4NzM="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/11870725774_10152417665140775/likes?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=MTAyMDQxNDY5NTEwMjQ4NzM%3D"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 84}, "data": [{"id": "10204146951024873", "name": "Grace Tma Voller"}]}, "urls": [], "created_time": "2014-05-01T21:39:01+0000", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"1": 1, "3": 13, "2": 17, "5": 34, "4": 12}, "reeng": {"10": 69, "3": 1, "2": 1, "7": 1, "6": 3, "9": 1, "8": 1}, "month": 1.2987012987}, "type": "link", "id": "11870725774_10152417665140775", "name": "Oil Free Otago"}
