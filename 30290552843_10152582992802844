Make compulsory for new construction. Apply solar panel on government infrastructure. Easy to pulg in everywhere parking for charging. Free from mafia pollution disease . Zero emission zero noise pollution,zero maintenance for electric vehicles.make in India. New horizons for automobile industry.Era of electrified electric vvehicle n bye to fuel engine .As Compulsory of using dth across the country like that solar panels will set up on every roof of India. Step by Step. On avg 210 days sunshine on bharat per year,Our country is hot let's turn that hotness in to clean green energy power source. Research on solar panels n batteries. Iron aluminium sodium glucose/bio batteries should be invented. After that 2 wheeler electric then 4 wheeler then public transporter.#Indianelectricvehicle #mumukinhaielectricvechile  \n     We never respected what we get in free of cost. No value of sun energy. Many Indian ppl have have calcium deficiency even we live in tropical country. What a big shame!!\n     All Universities, hospitals, army area, Government offices, parking, divider, highways, bus stop, railway station, bridge's, parks, forest fence, school's , college's, apartments, malls,dams, every roof of country, even on bus trains all kind of public transport should be installing solar or other forms of clean energy. We need to set an example for generations to come. And this is possible because we will be superpower one day! Must to do.\n\nUse LIC 5% money in solar panels for every roof. First set an example, select one random small village of UP where load shedding exist for 8- 9 hour. Install there solar panels on every roof of village and see the difference in one year ask real time ppl how their life changed with solar power. And rest country will follow that.\n\nhttps://solarthermalmagazine.com/2014/03/13/kingspans-largest-solar-thermal-panel-systems-to-date-at-a-prestigious-us-university/\n\nThank  you  \nCOMMON  MAN", "id": "10152552989982844_10152583586632844", "user_likes": false}]}}
