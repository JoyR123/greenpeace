Religious charlatans are financial frauds, but political charlatans are very dangerous and harmful financial frauds. These charlatans clearly joined forces. When supernatural nonsense becomes the norm for our media and government, reason and evidenced based science is tossed into the garbage as untrustworthy or the work of the devil. We argue back, calmly or militantly explain, mock, show more evidence, and fight to implore reason but it all to often falls on deaf ears and blind eyes.\n\nFacts show our religious and political moderates lean to the Gospel of Fox News because they claim that \"both sides of the controversy\" need to be examined. That's a sad reality. I hate to come off so pessimistic but I've been fighting this nonsense, along with many of you, for a few years and it seems to be getting worse, not better.\n\nI'm frustrated and really could use some encouragement to keep fighting the good fight. How are we ever going to gain a majority of citizens to trust reason, demonstrable evidence, and critical thinking let alone climate science, when we are unable to educate our citizens that human life evolved? Carl Sagan warned about the dangers of technology in an uneducated nation yet our public fails to understand basic human biology. As a result women will suffer and be left with very few reproductive health options, unless, of course, they have plenty of money. The grip on reason in an unreasonable nation is spiraling out of control. The damage unreasonable money and/or deity thinking ideologies produce is global.\n\nThe all to well oiled machine that produces hateful, hurtful, lethal and greedy conservative politicians holds the lion share of our world at risk. As long as humanity has a brain and a heart beat, those that critically examine evidence and fight to provide real solutions that help one another, benefit all life, and our planet, will continue to garner the strength required to combat nonsense.", "id": "10152141811569684_29453162", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2014, 1, 5, 15], "full_picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQANFmbdFIxMDWx7&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scientificamerican.com%2Fmedia%2Finline%2Fclimate-change-damage-to-poor-countries-goes-far-beyond-money_1.jpg", "caption": "scientificamerican.com", "edge": "posts", "link": "http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=climate-change-damage-to-poor-countries-goes-far-beyond-money&WT.mc_id=SA_sharetool_Twitter", "shares": {"count": 124}, "urls": [], "created_time": "2014-01-05T15:00:01+0000", "message": "Climate change is affecting entire cultures and ways of life in places like Micronesia.
