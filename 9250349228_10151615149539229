At least, they used to be - before forest destroyers like April got there. April is the second largest paper company in Indonesia, and still thinks it's okay to pulp what's left of the rainforest.\n\nBut pressure is mounting. Greenpeace complained to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, of which April is a member. Now the WBCSD has given April a year to put down its chainsaws or get out of the clubhouse. \n\nThis might sound like small beer, but April will take this seriously. Being ousted would send a very clear message to its customers that it's not a company they should do business with. \n\nIf it wants to keep its customers, April needs to stop destroying the rainforest - and quickly, while there is still some forest left. http://bit.ly/1mgcZG9", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"1": 1855}, "reeng": {"10": 402, "3": 2, "2": 794, "5": 11, "4": 290, "7": 15, "6": 184, "9": 14, "8": 143}, "month": 100.0}, "type": "photo", "id": "9250349228_10151615149539229", "petition": null, "comments": {"months": {"1": 119}, "reeng": {"10": 17, "2": 70, "4": 13, "7": 1, "6": 9, "9": 1, "8": 8}, "month": 100.0, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTIy", "before": "MTIy"}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/9250349228_10151615149539229/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=MTIy"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 122, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "838050039602557", "name": "Sarah Louise Railton"}, "like_count": 65, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-01-19T10:04:35+0000", "message": "It angers me so much .
