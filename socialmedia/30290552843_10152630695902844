Today I was sickened to see it was brutally felled...  Where there was the tree's unconditional shade,  there stands an ugly stump... And all because a guy wanted to reduce his workload by making way for vehicles to come a few yards closer to his workshop..  How I wish Greenpeace,  which incidentally has an office in the vicinity, could take up the cause of trees being chopped in the thickening concrete jungle..  If individuals could stop trees from being chopped,  we would not lose our precious foliage...  It is upto the self proclaimed saviours of green to take an effective stand against tree fellers past,present and future.. Atleast create some high decibel awareness among people so that individuals like me could have a few people to support me when I tried to save the tree..  But Greenpeace couldn't care less... Nothing to gain from saving a nameless tree, right?  No headlines or media brownie points..  No corporate house to extort..  So Greenpeace chooses to stay in peace as all the green around its office gets denuded one tree at a time..  Indeed,  easy to malign...", "id": "10152630478957844_10152630925722844", "user_likes": false}]}}
