The Warrior gave chase but the tanker was too fast - it looked like the Warrior would not be able to catch up.\n\nAs the tanker slowed down to turn, the more nimble Rainbow Warrior slipped in front and managed to put itself between the tanker and the dock.\n\nCaptain of the Warrior Pete Wilcox of the Arctic 30 stood his ground at the helm as the vast tanker towered over the Warrior. Dutch police stormed the Warrior, took control and arrested the crew.\n\nUnder the command of the Dutch police, the Rainbow Warrior was sailed away from the tanker. In the meantime, Greenpeace climbers on the side of the tanker continued to prevent it from unloading its dirty oil cargo.\n\nStand with millions around the world to say no to Arctic oil drilling >> http://bit.ly/R3eNtL\n\nUpdate at 5:54pm: all activists have now been released from prison. One boat driver remains in custody until tomorrow as there was not enough time to process his case today.", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"1": 1692, "3": 442, "2": 752, "5": 744, "4": 320}, "reeng": {"10": 1416, "3": 104, "2": 1655, "5": 78, "4": 376, "7": 41, "6": 138, "9": 45, "8": 97}, "month": 42.835443038}, "type": "photo", "id": "9250349228_10151783792679229", "petition": {"cc": "OO", "basket": "polar", "issue": "save the arctic"}, "comments": {"months": {"1": 313, "3": 51, "2": 108, "5": 32, "4": 22}, "reeng": {"10": 72, "3": 15, "2": 309, "5": 7, "4": 81, "7": 3, "6": 22, "9": 7, "8": 10}, "month": 59.5057034221, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "NTQ0", "before": "NTQ0"}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/9250349228_10151783792679229/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=NTQ0"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 545, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "633692986765283", "name": "Edward David Alexander"}, "like_count": 54, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-05-01T11:47:02+0000", "message": "", "id": "10151783757539229_10151783815839229", "user_likes": false}]}}
