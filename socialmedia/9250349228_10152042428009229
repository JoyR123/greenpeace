So protesting about something that will be in decline?\n\nDid you disrupt the energy companies? No because they have stockpiles available at Cottam. Did you disrupt the supply line? No as coal trains wait in yards ready to run to Cottam? Did you create a positive message? Hardly, trespass, impersonating railway employees, technically theft as you moved Coal from wagons into bags away from the train.\n\nAnd you left the scene in a mess leaving members of staff to clean up your mess that you creates, giving staff extra pay in overtime.
