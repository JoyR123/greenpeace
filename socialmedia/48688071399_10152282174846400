It is much the same as saying that all was done in good faith. As good as that may sound, intentions alone cannot stop climate change. Consistency is a matter of showing in concrete terms rather than speaking motherhood statements that makes one credible. That is why we need leaders that demand action, while at the same time acting upon the need to provide leadership in matters related to climate change."}
