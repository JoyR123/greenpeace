I would like to point out that linking the politics with our work as an environmental NGO is a must, contradictory to a lot of opinions on this page. Greenpeace in India and the rest of the world works on policy changes with the government to ensure that the environment does not have to deal with consequences of unsustainable development model. It's our job and our right to question the ruling party (who ever it is) on their model and remind them of their promises to people (not just people who have access to social media and can be offended but also the >50% of the population that can't share their opinions). Just 4 months ago, we criticised the UPA govt. on their rapid clearances by Moily and if the government is now formed by another party, we will ask them to protect the environment through the right policies.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/greenpeaceindia/photos/pb.30290552843.-2207520000.1403773848./10151961710307844/?type=3&theater\n\nIf instead of the concerns in the above post, some of us see intentions or a hidden agenda, let us be clear about that. We receive 39% of our funding from outside of India mostly Greenpeace International (please check their funding sources) and the rest of our 61% comes from 3 lakh Indian donors, approx 1 in every 4033 Indians. We have a clear agenda and that is to ensure a model of development that ensures environmentally and financially sustainable development and development for all.", "id": "10152192085512844_10152195969452844", "user_likes": false}]}, "height": 443, "created_time": "2014-06-24T15:00:01+0000", "width": 504, "edge": "objects", "likes": {"months": {"1": 113, "3": 34, "2": 40, "5": 33, "4": 41, "6": 54}, "reeng": {"10": 194, "1": 55, "3": 17, "2": 5, "5": 22, "4": 4, "7": 9, "6": 1, "9": 5, "8": 3}, "month": 35.873015873, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "OTg4ODk3NzQ0NDYyNzYy", "before": "OTg4ODk3NzQ0NDYyNzYy"}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/10152192085512844/likes?access_token=192154930871376%7CUId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&pretty=0&summary=1&limit=1&after=OTg4ODk3NzQ0NDYyNzYy"}, "new": 17.4603174603, "summary": {"total_count": 325}, "data": [{"id": "988897744462762", "name": "Roshan Gokul Bhosale"}]}, "urls": [], "images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10304565_10152192085512844_6299361811275161114_n.jpg?oh=009b0a87bcecd225b17e95e017ab94ae&oe=560BA351", "height": 443, "width": 504}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p320x320/10304565_10152192085512844_6299361811275161114_n.jpg?oh=985fde7be1bcdf0d9dcffd34eb169f2b&oe=5608F519", "height": 320, "width": 364}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p130x130/10304565_10152192085512844_6299361811275161114_n.jpg?oh=5c3d52a939fe697b20244f502a6bc874&oe=55C6C809", "height": 130, "width": 147}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p75x225/10304565_10152192085512844_6299361811275161114_n.jpg?oh=2e94dd72f11670de3be5247568893830&oe=560C8C77", "height": 225, "width": 255}], "total": {"new": 17.1830985915, "months": {"1": 132, "3": 41, "2": 48, "5": 34, "4": 41, "6": 59}, "reeng": {"10": 211, "1": 61, "3": 18, "2": 7, "5": 30, "4": 4, "7": 10, "6": 2, "9": 7, "8": 5}, "month": 37.1830985915}, "id": "10152192085512844"}
