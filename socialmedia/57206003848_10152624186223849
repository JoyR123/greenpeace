The process releases unknown quantities of chemical concoctions via drill fluids, biocides, frack fluids and polymers as well as liberating naturally occurring toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulphide, VOCs, radon and metals like mercury and lead contaminating land, air and water. No one knows the interconnectivity of aquifers. The initial act of drilling through the aquifers results in cross contamination, mixes water of varying qualities, and creates pathways for gasses to migrate. The fracking is worse. Once the coal seams are fractured and depressurised by the removal of coal seam water (toxic water, toxic waste), the gasses take the path of least resistance to the surface. They migrate through cracks and fissures in the ground and shattered rocks to the surface killing trees, contaminating soil and livestock, poisoning groundwater harming health. Fracking benefits the greedy, outdated, fossil fuel corporations willing to sacrifice our health and human rights destroying the environment, existing livelihoods and robbing future generations of opportunities to a healthy and sustainable future..\nSolar panels, wind turbines and tidal power do not threaten our communities, our safety, our air, water and environment as fracking does. We have choices here. Why are governments protecting fossil fuel corporations allowing practices such as this when we can have free energy from renewables?", "id": "10152622083283849_17055523", "user_likes": false}]}}
