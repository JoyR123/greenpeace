Thats exactly why we are kicking 2014 off with a bang and launching a 6 week community campaign to put pressure on Newman to make the Reef a major election issue. \n\nWe know Newman has the power to save the reef.\nWe know he will listen to people who hold real power - his voters.\nAnd of course, we know that Queenslanders want to see our reef safe and protected.\n\nThat's why this Feb and March, Greenpeace volunteers will be walking the streets of Ashgrove, Newman's electorate, talking to real people about why they care about the reef, and asking voters to sign a postcard that will be sent to Newman, showing that the community wants to see the reef saved.\n\nThe community outreach and engagement aspect of the campaign will be done through trusty old door knocking, which is said to be the MOST effective campaigning tactic out there!\n\nIt would be absolutely FANTASTIC if you could come along to a door-knocking session or two so that way we can reach the maximum number of people in Ashgrove.\n\nFor other session times and meeting places head to these Facebook events:\n- Session 7: Sun 16th 2pm http://tinyurl.com/sesh7\n- Session 9: Sat 22nd 2pm http://tinyurl.com/sesh99\n\nPlease feel free to call us on 0449792044 or email opal.sternbaum@greenpeace.org for more information"}
