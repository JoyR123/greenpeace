I spent 64 days locked up in a Russian prison following a peaceful protest against the world\u2019s first oil platform to drill in the icy waters of the Arctic. Those 64 days were undoubtedly the hardest days of my life but also my proudest. I felt the luckiest person on earth when I stepped on board the Arctic Sunrise back in September because I had been given an opportunity to do something that mattered. \n\nNow, I feel even luckier. Your support means my 29 friends and I are free, your support also means my time in prison wasn\u2019t spent in vain.\n\nI\u2019m back in the office and wanted to say \u2018hi\u2019 and a warm hearted \u2018thank you'! Thank you for standing up for me and for the Arctic. \n\nYou can read more about my story here >> http://bit.ly/1mGjJzZ", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"1": 2797}, "reeng": {"10": 559, "3": 28, "2": 1229, "5": 28, "4": 467, "7": 37, "6": 239, "9": 42, "8": 168}, "month": 100.0}, "type": "photo", "id": "9250349228_10151620385509229", "petition": null, "comments": {"months": {"1": 175}, "reeng": {"10": 39, "3": 1, "2": 69, "5": 1, "4": 36, "7": 2, "6": 14, "9": 4, "8": 9}, "month": 100.0, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTgy", "before": "MTgy"}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/9250349228_10151620385509229/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=MTgy"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 182, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "640211756099223", "name": "Jo Baxter"}, "like_count": 62, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-01-22T17:34:11+0000", "message": "I've done nothing compared to you, you are a brave young woman with the courage of your convictions, and an example to us all.
