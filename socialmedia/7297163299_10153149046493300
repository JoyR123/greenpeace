But WE must convince politicians that we want to consume LESS not more. There is no political will because the uncomfortable truth is that the majority of people in the industrialised, wealthy nations either don't realise, or don't care that the real price of our cheap flights and consumer excess is paid for by the poorest people on the planet, for whom climate change means drought, flood and famine. The people with most to lose as a result of our behaviour have basic needs like clean water, food and education to improve their lot. They will probably never get on an aeroplane, so why should they suffer so we can enjoy cheap flights, drive bigger cars, leave the lights on and waste the planet's precious resources. Politicians  in wealthy countries aren't dealing with this because their electorate are constantly telling them they want MORE STUFF, not less!", "id": "10153149046493300_10153149119988300", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2015, 6, 23, 10], "full_picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDYjVIvWnPWqQe6&url=https%3A%2F%2Fscontent-ams3-1.xx.fbcdn.net%2Fhphotos-xtf1%2Ft31.0-8%2Fs720x720%2F11427342_10153149045828300_4545064251623105708_o.jpg", "caption": "theguardian.com", "edge": "posts", "link": "http://grnpc.org/IgtKw", "shares": {"count": 378}, "urls": [], "created_time": "2015-06-23T10:26:07+0000", "message": "Pharmaceuticals, doctors and nurses can't change our health prospects as much as energy companies could.", "total": {"new": 2.9985007496, "months": {"11": 53, "10": 67, "12": 517, "1": 306, "3": 175, "2": 228, "5": 126, "4": 138, "7": 103, "6": 102, "9": 92, "8": 94}, "reeng": {"10": 1684, "1": 60, "3": 34, "2": 32, "5": 37, "4": 35, "7": 29, "6": 35, "9": 27, "8": 28}, "month": 15.2923538231}, "type": "link", "id": "7297163299_10153149046493300", "description": "Slashing fossil fuel use also presents greatest global opportunity to..."}
