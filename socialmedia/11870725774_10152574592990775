The only reason they\u2019re able to do this is because the Arctic ice is melting due to climate change as a result of burning fossil fuels like oil. It\u2019s extremely risky to dill in the Arctic and any oil spill in those freezing conditions would be impossible to clean up.\n\nOne of the ways Shell plans to get away with this is by spending lots of money on making itself appear caring and family friendly by putting their branding on the things we love - like LEGO toys. It is using its relationship with the popular toy maker to divert attention away from its dangerous plans.\n\nShell plans to renew a deal with LEGO later this year. We're asking LEGO to cut ties with Shell.\n\nSIGN and SHARE now to show LEGO and Shell we won't give up >> http://bitly.com/1w7VdK8\n\nLEGO have already committed to making their blocks from materials not derived from oil in the future, we're asking them now to take a stand for the Arctic.", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"1": 62, "3": 26, "2": 54, "5": 32, "4": 40, "7": 93, "6": 45}, "reeng": {"10": 244, "3": 12, "2": 37, "5": 9, "4": 15, "7": 10, "6": 15, "9": 4, "8": 6}, "month": 17.6136363636}, "type": "photo", "id": "11870725774_10152574592990775", "petition": null, "comments": {"months": {"1": 15, "3": 1, "2": 4, "5": 1, "4": 1, "7": 15, "6": 3}, "reeng": {"10": 22, "3": 3, "2": 9, "5": 1, "4": 1, "6": 4}, "month": 37.5, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "NDg=", "before": "NDg="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/11870725774_10152574592990775/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=NDg%3D"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 48, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "946395445400069", "name": "Nellie May Hunt"}, "like_count": 10, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-07-11T01:14:14+0000", "message": "Well that doesn't sound bloody fair YouTube sounds like someone should boycott them for that, how can they justify there actions unless they are bowing down to the corporate agencies who are only worried bout their profits, what a Joke YouTube are damn disgraceful ", "id": "10152574586060775_10152574611335775", "user_likes": false}]}}
