But we're showing Shell it sure made a mistake by choosing Seattle as the home base for its Arctic destroyers! The drilling equipment is on its way to Seattle right now, and it will sit in the Seattle Harbor as we'll gather in community to say, \"Shell No!\" \n\nSpeakers will include Katrina Pestano of Bayan, Precious Butiu of Gabriela Seattle, Sarra Tekola of Divest - UW, Jill Mangaliman of Got Green, Annie Leonard of Greenpeace USA, Sundance Chief Rueben George, and Aji and Adonis Piper with Plant for the Planet.\n\nJoin us on April 26th to tell Shell: Seattle draws the line!\n\nThis event is hosted by: 350 Seattle, Alaska Wilderness League, Bayan, Backbone Campaign, Climate Solutions, Coalition for Port Accountability, Divest - UW, Green Party of Seattle, Greenpeace, Plant-for-the-Planet, Rising Tide Seattle, and Sierra Club - Washington State Chapter"}
