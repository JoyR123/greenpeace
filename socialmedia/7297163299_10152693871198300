Now everyone wants to go the Nazca lines, but to see the area affected by Greenpeace\u2019s actions,\u201d he added.\n\nCastillo told the Guardian that Peruvian authorities had identified six members of the group who participated in the protest at the Unesco world heritage site last week, adding that prosecutors have filed charges of attacking archaeological monuments - a crime punishable by up to six years in prison.\n\nBut the minister said Greenpeace had refused to name all the protesters \u2013 leaving Peru no choice but to pursue it \u201cthrough our legal means\u201d.\n\n\u201cGreenpeace says it wants to take responsibility but in not giving us the names so that those responsible can appear before a judge in Peru it is refusing to do that,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s a contradiction in terms.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes you wonder if they really are as ashamed as they say they are.\u201d\n\nAs UN climate talks began in Peru\u2019s capital last week, around 20 activists entered a restricted area to leave sign reading \u201cTime for Change! The Future is Renewable\u201d beside the giant figure of hummingbird scratched in the desert ground more than 1,000 years ago.\n\nArchaeologists say footprints left by the activists could remain in the arid desert ground for decades. Castillo said that footage of the protest showed the activists acting as if they were on a \u201cpicnic\u201d.\n\n\u201cPeru is not asking for money, first we want to know what happened and for those responsible to face justice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of money. The destruction is irreparable,\u201d said Ana Mar\u00eda Cogorno, president of the Maria Reiche Association, named after the German archaeologist whose groundbreaking research on the Nazca lines from 1940 onwards saw them gain recognition and protection.\n\nThe hummingbird etching on which the Greenpeace stunt was laid was the \u201conly one of the lines which was completely untouched and perfectly conserved,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the symbols of Peru,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter a meeting with Greenpeace\u2019s executive director, Kumi Naidoo, on Monday, Peru\u2019s minister for culture, Diana \u00c1lvarez-Calder\u00f3n, said the group\u2019s failure to reveal the protesters\u2019 names amounted to a \u201c kind of cover-up\u201d. \n\nShe said Naidoo had asked for 30 days for Greenpeace to carry out an internal investigation.\n\nThe activists have all returned to their home countries \u2013 believed to include Germany, Colombia and Argentina.\n\nLast week a Peruvian judge rejected prosecutors\u2019 request to keep the activists in the country to face questioning, citing incomplete information.\n\n\u201cWe respect the judiciary but we don\u2019t agree with how they acted on this occasion, \u00c1lvarez-Calder\u00f3n told reporters later, adding that while Greenpeace had apologised it \u201cdid not repair the damage to our heritage\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have to continue the process when a person is not in Peru \u2013 extradition if the judge decides so or civil reparation,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also said that an activist who appeared on a promotional video released by Greenpeace had been located and was expected to reveal who had been part of the team, as well as the identity of the archaeologist who took them to the site.\n\nIn a blogpost on Tuesday John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, made clear his disapproval of the stunt, which was apparently organised to highlight the slow progress of the United Nations climate talks in Lima.\n\n\u201cFor many years, Greenpeace offices around the world have been making concerted efforts to reach out to and collaborate with communities everywhere. We understand the importance of being a respectful ally who can learn from our partners and ensure the work we do reflects and supports all communities. This action did not measure up to that commitment. But this activity is not who we are. It is not what we believe in, and this is not what I believe in,\u201d Sauven wrote.\n\nKyle Ash, a Greenpeace spokesman, said that the group had taken \u201cevery care\u201d to avoid any damage. \u201cThe surprise to us was that this resulted in some kind of moral offence. We definitely regret that and we want to figure out a way to resolve it.\u201d", "id": "10152693871198300_10152694045133300", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2014, 12, 19, 10], "full_picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDOXvYIOE0YzC5j&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenpeace.org%2Finternational%2Fcommunity_images%2F84%2F2284%2F108718_177132.jpg", "caption": "greenpeace.org", "edge": "posts", "link": "http://grnpc.org/IgeKd", "shares": {"count": 212}, "urls": [], "created_time": "2014-12-19T10:05:07+0000", "total": {"new": 5.8624577227, "months": {"11": 85, "10": 85, "12": 285, "1": 260, "3": 162, "2": 272, "5": 104, "4": 127, "7": 102, "6": 105, "9": 99, "8": 88}, "reeng": {"10": 1408, "1": 104, "3": 49, "2": 48, "5": 32, "4": 24, "7": 33, "6": 23, "9": 28, "8": 25}, "month": 14.6561443067}, "type": "link", "id": "7297163299_10152693871198300", "description": "Ecological farmers in the Philippines have pooled their expertise and resources and travelled to help farmers in Dolores, Eastern Samar, get back on their feet following Typhoon Hagupit."}
