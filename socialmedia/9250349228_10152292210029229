For three years, they were sick \u2014 chronic rashes, bloody noses, and muscle spasms. Lisa\u2019s lymph nodes stuck out of her neck like ping pong balls. Emma, then seven, was sent to the hospital for her symptoms.\nThe culprit, they deciphered, was air pollution from more than 100 natural gas wells located within two miles of their home. They sued the eight oil companies that owned the wells, including Aruba Petroleum, which eventually became the focus of the case. And in April, a Texas jury decided that Aruba\u2019s fracking operations were responsible for the pollution and that the Parr family should be compensated to the tune of $2.95 million.\nAND\nJanuary has been a shaky month for Irving, Texas. Twelve earthquakes rattled the city during a 48-hour period at the end of the first week of the new year.\n\u201cIt was very scary. I was at my job on the 4th floor in a cubicle surrounded by glass,\u201d Tonya Rochelle Tatum, a loan specialist who works in Irving, told DeSmogBlog. \u201cOne quake seemed like it lasted five minutes. No one knew what to do.\u201d\nThe earthquake swarm shows no sign of stopping. On January 21, five more quakes struck.\nThe quakes are relatively small, all of them registering under 4 on the Richter Scale. None has caused significant damage to property or resulted in bodily harm \u2014 but that hasn\u2019t stopped people from worrying about their personal safety and property.\nRead more\nhttp://netzfrauen.org/2015/02/05/risiken-beim-fracking-texas-familie-erhaelt-3-millionen-entschaedigung-texas-family-wins-3m-fracking-pollution-lawsuit/", "id": "10152291075674229_10152292230064229", "user_likes": false}]}}
