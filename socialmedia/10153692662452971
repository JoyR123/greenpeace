The village is located in the state of Rajasthan, a region with such a strong preference for boys that the sex ratio is now skewed to 928 women for every 1000 men. The village of Piplantri, whose tree-planting project has transformed it into a green oasis with a quarter of a million new trees planted over the past six years, is leading the way on changing attitudes on how girls are valued. \n\nThe initiative was started by the former village head, Shyam Sundar Paliwal, in memory of his daughter Kiran who died in 2007. In addition to tree-planting, the community also makes a collective investment in their girls. When a girl is born, parents sign an affidavit agreeing to educate their daughter and not to marry her until she reaches the legal age. In return, the whole community contributes to her future financial well-bring: the villagers donate 21,000 Rupees ($335) to the parents\u2019 contribution of 10,000 Rupees ($160), all of which is deposited in a bank account that cannot be accessed until the girl turns 20 years old. \n\nOver the six years the program has been going on, the impact on the village of 8,000 has been dramatic. In addition to making the area around the village lush and green, it has also brought economic and social benefits to the community as a whole. To help protect the trees from insects, the villagers have planted over 2.5 million Aloe vera plants around them which they now harvest sustainability to produce a variety of Aloe-based products for sale. And, most importantly, in a region with a deeply entrenched preference for boys, Piplantri is showing how honoring girls not only empowers girls and women, it uplifts entire communities. \n\nTo read
