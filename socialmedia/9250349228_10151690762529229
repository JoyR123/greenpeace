I'm not vegetarian or vegan. I love meat. We are human, we have canine teeth, we are designed to eat meat. Not that I have an issue with veggies or vegans, everyone has a right to make their own choices. After all, a lioness who kills a gazelle is doing so to survive & feed her family. \nI think the point is much, much deeper. \nAs humans we need to start managing our product supply & food supply in a way that does not impact on our planet the way palm oil plantations or trawling or whatever!! We need to manage our population better so we're not taking so much & giving back less. One of the biggest issues are people who believe they have the right to sick two fingers up to the global community, and have this \"I'll do what I damn well like\" attitude to life. We are visitors to this planet, we have responsibilities to every other creature who SHARES it with us. \nPhillip's right, we have a choice. I welcome an organisation like Greenpeace shaming these firms, telling us the truth about what is happening out there. People power is far stronger than these firms like P&G will ever be.  Their job is to give us what we want, so fight back. Tell them they're greedy scum bags. As soon as they start loosing their valuable money they'll either change their ways or they'll crumble under their own weight. I for one hope they'll change, but if they don't I'll enjoy watching them pack up & do one!!!", "id": "10151690762439229_8771922", "user_likes": false}]}}
