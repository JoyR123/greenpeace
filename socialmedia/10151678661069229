We moved much faster than many of our competitors to make sure our own-brand tuna is 100% pole and line** \n\nlie - Waitrose, Sainsbury, Morrisons and ASDA were faster. Tesco had to be coerced\n\nWe have also promised to use sustainable tuna in other products like pastas, sandwiches and salads. Many of our competitors continue to sell non-pole and line caught tuna.  Customers have a great choice of sustainable tuna at Tesco.**\n\nTortology: Promised - that's all they've done. The tuna in question IS trawled. Tesco sells trawled.\n\nSusan, we study what we can see as indicators of what we can't. Visibles, like seals, whales and polar bears indicate problems and deficiencies all down the food chain. While we continue to expose, name and shame and call to account the corporations who will kill our children's planet for a fast buck, it will NEVER be out of sight or mind.
