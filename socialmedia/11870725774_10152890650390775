This ought to give companies like Shell pause for thought as it considers its own partnerships in Russia, as well as its plans to drill expensive wells in the Alaskan Arctic.\n\nSign the petition for a global sanctuary in the Arctic here:\nhttp://www.savethearctic.org", "total": {"new": 1.3698630137, "months": {"11": 9, "10": 7, "12": 34, "1": 4, "3": 12, "2": 16, "5": 8, "4": 17, "7": 15, "6": 11, "9": 8, "8": 5}, "reeng": {"10": 134, "1": 2, "3": 1, "2": 3, "5": 2, "4": 1, "7": 1, "6": 1, "9": 1}, "month": 2.7397260274}, "type": "link", "id": "11870725774_10152890650390775", "description": "Exxon Mobil Corp. and OAO Rosneft terminated contracts for five service vessels operated by Norway\u2019s Siem Offshore Inc. and Rem Offshore ASA as sanctions upend plans to explore the Russian Arctic."}
