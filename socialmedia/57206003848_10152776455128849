And without water, we are not. Think about it... Almost everything, if not all of, our nutrients is being transported using this form in our bodies. I'm not a biologist, but this is making sense to me and, I hope it does to you i.e., water is like electric current in a conductor powering a house. I'm not an Electrician either, but I do know that Eskom requires a certain percentage of power to supply the electricity demand in our country [R.South Africa]. So if we stop drinking water, they'll be no biological function. Not only in our bodies, but our soil, too. So I love water the most because it's that bigger part keeping life on Earth.\r\n", "id": "10152776453318849_18208418", "user_likes": false}]}}
