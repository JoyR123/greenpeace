How is it possible that a longtime environmental agency like Greenpeace isn't ALL OVER THIS? Exposing the lies we...the human species are being told? About the animal and sea life already affected and the implications for our own species?? Why aren't you at least TRYING to take measurements and samples? What the hell are you all going to do when there is no more whale hunts to protest (valiant cause it may be) because the whales are gone. (Hint: and they won't disappear because of the horrific hunts-it will be a result of poison waters and radioactive isotopes) Asking people to get on board with establishing fish sanctuaries when the ocean is friggin dying. Really???  The bio-accumulation occurring is here NOW. The poison and problems are here NOW. I am personally witnessing once vibrant and diverse tide pools and established marine sanctuaries becoming graveyards. What are you all going to do for jobs? Why aren't you defending against the beast from the east? At LEAST being a voice of semi reason and objective player in this?? Why aren't you divulging accurate numbers on already toxic waters ?", "id": "10152515024274684_10152517660679684", "user_likes": false}]}}
