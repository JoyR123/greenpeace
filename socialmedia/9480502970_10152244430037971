Our lawyers have now signed the document legally transferring ownership of the vessel back to us.\n\nThe ship is free to leave, but its condition is unknown. We will be assessing this as a matter of urgency. We're now working as fast as we can to bring the Sunrise home.\n\nWe're ECSTATIC that the Sunrise will soon be free. But she should never have been detained in the first place. At no point was there any justification for the Arctic Sunrise\u2019s arrest or detention. Along with her crew, she was illegally seized at gunpoint by Russian authorities in international waters last September. \n\nSince that day, with the help of millions of people around, we have become stronger and more determined than ever before. \n\nTogether, we will save the Arctic.", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"1": 225, "3": 337, "2": 342, "5": 300, "4": 396, "6": 705}, "reeng": {"10": 1888, "3": 5, "2": 153, "5": 7, "4": 74, "7": 23, "6": 65, "9": 23, "8": 67}, "month": 9.7613882863}, "type": "photo", "id": "9480502970_10152244430037971", "petition": null, "comments": {"months": {"1": 8, "3": 12, "2": 15, "5": 7, "4": 9, "6": 21}, "reeng": {"10": 57, "2": 5, "4": 3, "7": 1, "6": 3, "9": 1, "8": 2}, "month": 11.1111111111, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "NzQ=", "before": "NzQ="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/9480502970_10152244430037971/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=883483195046454|9nfpAUxoDRMZ77lLiQ83CrnaV3s&after=NzQ%3D"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 74, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "10153232571849484", "name": "El Cooper"}, "like_count": 10, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-06-06T10:49:32+0000", "message": ":) fantastic, thanks for the excellent  news", "id": "10152244429987971_10152244435867971", "user_likes": false}]}}
