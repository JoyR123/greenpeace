Very interesting\nThe fight against global warming should save our planet. Instead, it is speeding up the destruction of our nature and biodiversity.\n\nClimate Crimes takes you behind the scenes of destructive energy policies disguised as green solutions to climate change.\n\nUlrich Eichelmann and his team visit the Mesopotamian Marshes in Iraq, the rainforests of the Amazon and Indonesia, Turkey\u2019s Southeast, as well as protected sites in Germany. All of them could be destroyed within the next decades due to hydropower plants, palm oil plantations and maize fields used to produce biofuel and biogas.\nYet Climate Crimes is a story of unique landscapes, rare species and of humans living in harmony with nature.
