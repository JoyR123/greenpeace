The NGO has accused the government of trying to strangle them by stealth.\nThe government, in its order, had said that on-site inspection of accounts and records conducted in September last year had revealed that the NGO had transferred foreign contributions in the FCRA designated bank account, and from there to five other accounts, without informing the concerned authorities, in violation of the rules. The Home Ministry also alleged that the NGO had under-reported and repeatedly mentioned incorrect amount of foreign funding. Now, as defendant, Green Peace India should be responding to charges raised by the government. But instead of doing that and after nearly 25 days, it has come up with this silly campaign that nearly 340 of its employees will be laid off and would be without work.\nNow, why is it that you are not putting your efforts in responding to the government's charges, and instead, wasting those efforts in playing a victim card and sponsoring posts and campaign on Facebook? If you cannot complete the legal recourse before June 1st, why is it that you are not saving the money left with you,and why are you throwing it away on Facebook promotions?\nAnd if we may ask, where is the money coming from for your promotions on Facebook? Is it from your own accounts, or are you flouting rules again?", "id": "10152855178132844_10152855187122844", "user_likes": false}]}}
