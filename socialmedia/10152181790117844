The former UPA government and the new BJP government have shown that dissenters will be dealt with  an iron fist. \n\nHere is a list of are those not angry with Greenpeace:  The 50,000 plus villagers of Mahan region, for whom, the forests of Mahan are the primary source of livelihood;  not the 300 million people of India, who still live without electricity after over 60 years of India\u2019s independence.
