Evidence from marine scientists around the world suggests that seismic testing could be bad for whales and dolphins. The government should have done research into this before it started issuing permits to big oil companies - but it has not.\n\nThis summer an unprecedented amount of seismic testing for deep sea oil is being done in NZ waters (mainly by foreign companies) including the Norwegian oil giant Statoil. \n\nIt's happening right now and it has been going on day and night, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for many weeks.\n\nThis surveying involves boats on the surface firing powerful pneumatic shock waves (using compressed air guns) into the water and kilometers into the ocean floor.  Seismic testing is done over huge areas of ocean and this repetitive seismic explosion can occur every few seconds day and night for weeks or even months on end.\n\nThese seismic air guns create intense underwater pressure waves.  (If a human diver was directly under one of the survey ships there would be high risk of serious injury or death.)\n\nAs you can imagine whales and dolphins are sensitive to this loud noise.  Because whales and dolphins depend on sounds waves to navigate, feed, mate and nurture their young they are vulnerable to loud underwater noises and some of the most concerning impacts may be long-term behaviour.  \n\nEvidence suggests that impacts could mean whales and dolphins can\u2019t hear one another easily or find food or care for their young (food location and communication involves sonar for many whale and dolphin species including pilot whales).  The seismic noise could also cause whales to become distressed and surface too quickly causing painful bends-like symptoms.  In extreme cases, it could cause physical damage and may lead to strandings and death.\n\nUnder new legislation seismic surveying is a permitted activity in New Zealand \u2013 no marine consent is needed and surveys can be carried out within certain guidelines. Statoil is required to submit a Marine Mammal Impact Assessment to the Department of Conservation but this information is not open to public review or challenge.\n\nThe Government has just issued a permit for seismic testing and possible drilling right inside the marine mammal sanctuary on the West Coast of the North Island.  A sanctuary created specifically to protect the world's rarest dolphin the Maui's.
