I googled it - to find out how I could have missed such an important movie? It  got blacklisted by the \"tea-party politics\" in the US, (the frackers, the oil drilling companies, the gas companies, the grid, etc etc etc) people who disn't want this film to get widespread publicity!!!!  In  other words - they wanted to keep its message \"quiet\"!  Watch it, please! & get your friends to watch it too - Give the dvd as birthday gifts, & Christmas presents,  like I have - it helps spread the word!

It aims to spark a broad national conversation about the risks of our headlong rush into massive coal seam gas development. Five years in the making, it not only entertains and engages, it also gives audiences the tools to get involved in what is becoming the largest social movement our nation has seen in decades. It\u2019s a deeply political film, but not the old style that is so badly failing us. This is the New Politics, bringing together old and young, city and country, conservative and progressive in a shared effort to prevent an environmental catastrophe.  Can we imagine any other issue that would bring together the likes of Alan Jones and Bob Brown? \nSee it and find out why.\n\nTake a stand with us and be part of the largest social movement in Australia\u2019s history.\n\nwww.frackmanthemovie.com"}
