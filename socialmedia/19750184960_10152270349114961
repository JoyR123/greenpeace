He composes a dense transnational bass music that collides the low frequency pressure of dubstep with high-level beat science, acoustic strings and voices. His work is described as \u201cthe prototype of globalized urban sound\u201d -Prefix Mag, and \u201cawesome and delicate...hybrids so fluent they defy classification\u201d -Pitchfork\n\nFilastine's latest album 'Requiem' is in the final stage of post-production and will drop around June 21. Back in 2012 Filastine released his third album, \u00a300T, alongside a grip of potent videos, and a year-long world tour which included our first BEATS NOT PIPELINES show at W2 Woodwards.  \n\nFilastine used percussion to fire off sounds and synchronized video from a heap of electronics wired to an amplified shopping cart. The live set used a custom software to pull off some deep AV madness, and had him touring the US with Beats Antique and Bassnectar. Before making electronic music Filastine played with the Infernal Noise Brigade, a marching band he founded for the Battle of Seattle. He continues to use sound as a tool for political intervention with the Sound Swarm, an orchestra of bike-mounted megaphones conducted by pirate radio transmitters. Back in the 90s he also played Under the Volcano Festival with Seattle's Tchkung! \n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| \n\nSee Monsters (Coast Salish)  10:15pm\n@[null:https://soundcloud.com/womp]\nSee Monsters is DJ Deano (Dean Hunt) and Amphibian 14 (Bracken Hanuse Corlett) an off shoot project of Skookum Sound System \n|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| \n\nMob Bounce 9:30pm\n@[null:https://soundcloud.com/mob-bounce]\n@[null:https://www.facebook.com/mobbounce]\nMob Bounce is Craigy Craig aka The Northwest Kid and Heebz The Earthchild.
