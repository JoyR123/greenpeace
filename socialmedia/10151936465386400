Coal remains a top energy producer world-wide. Its connection to water is a parasitic one.

These are people and places which already suffer from water-scarcity, but now see their livelihoods and health hung in the balance of an outmoded means of energy production.", "datetime": [2014, 3, 22, 13], "pid": 48688071399, "comments": {"months": {"1": 2, "3": 6}, "reeng": {"10": 7, "3": 1}, "month": 25.0, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "OA==", "before": "OA=="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/10151936465386400/comments?access_token=192154930871376%7CUId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&pretty=0&summary=1&limit=1&after=OA%3D%3D"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 8, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "10202618910072202", "name": "Zandro Laoyon Arcebuche"}, "like_count": 3, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-03-23T04:11:59+0000", "message": "Coincide with the gospel for today about the \"water of life\" as Jesus Christ offered to the Samaritan Woman...
