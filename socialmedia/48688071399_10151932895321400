It's typical corporate propaganda to protect their profit driving model. Of course it is safer than older nuclear designs, but it is still a MASSIVE risk that does not need taking and produces waste material that we CANNOT make safe and must be stored at very great expense forever, not to mention that land used for the plants will be poisoned for millennia.\n\nThe cost of renewables has shot down, and the technologies and options have increased. It's quite simple to start small scale with renewables, with virtually no risk (maybe the odd unlucky bird gets hit) and almost pollution free, plus it doesn't poison the land and doesn't produce deadly waste materials while in operation.\n\nParticularly in small rural communities, it would be a very simple matter to bring in simple wind generators, and maybe a few solar installations on rooftops, and get whole communities on completely renewable power, keeping those communities clean, safe and brining them into the 21st century. The future is certainly NOT nuclear power.", "id": "10151932890281400_11275198", "user_likes": false}]}}
