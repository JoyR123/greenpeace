We'd like to make it clear that our data is Real-Time. Our objective here is to highlight how severe the problem is. It's the quality of the air that we are trying to establish and it is what we are being exposed to time and again. \n\nHaving a monitoring station in a particular locality at a particular height as per the norms is great. but exposing what the real time exposure of the public is equally necessary.\n\nWe have been working with the Govt to implement health advisories for schools and vulnerable groups on heavily polluted days and due to the freeze on our funds we've not been able to move forward on that front.\n\nWe are also working with the govt on setting stringent standards for polluting industries. \n\nPlease stay tuned for some fresh data on different cities across the country. We will be putting it out in the next couple of weeks.\n\nThanks :)", "id": "10152877652892844_10152879588107844", "user_likes": false}]}}
