Only BJP and its affiliates are fighting tooth and nail for the implementation of Madhav Gadgil committee proposals! It is very disturbing that these fronts, which are supposed to work for the protection of our environment for the sustenance of many generations to come, are up in arms even against the much watered down proposals of Kasturi Rangan report!  Only the Idukki MP, Mr.P.T.Thomas steadfastly stood his ground in favour of the proposals laid down in the Kasturi Rangan report! He even went to the extent of admonishing the Chief Minister belonging to his own party on his poor leadership qualities by saying that a leader should be able to lead the people through unpopular but right path! In such a scenario, how could we expect our leaders to protect our pristine forests?
