Here's why: Greenpeace was founded based on the principle that it's important to bear witness to and stand up against injustice. When peaceful protesters, many standing with their hands up, are met with huge guns, it's a violation of first amendment rights and a threat to our democracy. \n\nWe also want to thank all the Greenpeace supporters who have been standing up for Ferguson and Mike Brown in the comments.\n\n", "total": {"new": 12.6776577601, "months": {"1": 336, "3": 158, "2": 198, "5": 139, "4": 156, "7": 163, "6": 150, "8": 459}, "reeng": {"10": 1203, "1": 223, "3": 81, "2": 41, "5": 53, "4": 39, "7": 37, "6": 34, "9": 23, "8": 25}, "month": 19.101762365}, "type": "link", "id": "5435784683_10152673884039684", "description": "Greenpeace US Executive Director Annie Leonard advocates for peaceful protest in the wake of Ferguson, Missouri unrest and reported police brutality."}
