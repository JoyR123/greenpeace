For those saying it doesn't do anything, it's not just about going dark for an hour. It's showing your commitment for protecting this planet, going beyond the hour and making changes in your life to make a good impact on our environment. Every year I challenge myself to do something I feel is significant. In previous years, I've given up styrofoam, I've recycled so much at my previous job that they could get rid of their dumpster (I'm working towards that at my current job), I volunteer my time to clean our local parks, bicycle and car pool when I can. To me that's what Earth Hour is. Sorry for the book, just wanted to share. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udf0e", "id": "10153233955129684_10153238197889684", "user_likes": false}]}}
