We'd like to inform you that we have been in constant conversation with the government over the issue. We have always been prompt and transparent in sharing all required details with the concerned authorities. This time as well we have provided our official response within the stipulated time and requested the MHA to respond on the same. Greenpeace India, in no way, believes in being in constant opposition to the Government as mentioned by you.\n\nAs far as seeking a judicial intervention in this matter is suggested, we'd like to inform you that the same is not negated at this point of time.\n\nWe would like you to understand that while our accounts have been blocked by the MHA, we still need money to carry forward our legal endeavors. This is the reason why we have been highlighting this issue to our patrons.\n\nHope that satisfies your queries.\n\nThanks", "id": "10152865616997844_10152865684387844", "user_likes": false}]}, "height": 720, "created_time": "2015-05-15T11:10:33+0000", "width": 720, "edge": "objects", "likes": {"months": {"11": 31, "10": 24, "12": 143, "1": 180, "3": 57, "2": 72, "5": 29, "4": 36, "7": 26, "6": 30, "9": 25, "8": 20}, "reeng": {"10": 420, "1": 108, "3": 44, "2": 6, "5": 35, "4": 13, "7": 13, "6": 10, "9": 17, "8": 7}, "month": 26.7459138187, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAyMDcwNjUxMDkwNDY1ODg=", "before": "MTAyMDcwNjUxMDkwNDY1ODg="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/10152865616997844/likes?access_token=192154930871376%7CUId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&pretty=0&summary=1&limit=1&after=MTAyMDcwNjUxMDkwNDY1ODg%3D"}, "new": 16.0475482912, "summary": {"total_count": 686}, "data": [{"id": "10207065109046588", "name": "Kiruba Sankar"}]}, "urls": [{"components": {"fragment": "", "netloc": "act.greenpeace.in", "params": "", "query": {"utm_campaign": "Legitimacy", "utm_medium": "post", "utm_source": "facebook.com", "utm_term": "Banner"}, "path": ["freedomofspeech"], "scheme": "http"}, "url": "http://bit.ly/1PKhRSu", "driver": null, "ea": {"ea.campaign.id": null, "ea.client.id": null}, "redir": {"service": "bit.ly", "url": "http://act.greenpeace.in/freedomofspeech/?utm_campaign=Legitimacy&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=post&utm_term=Banner", "surl": "1PKhRSu", "key": "0d9c1b004646651e10874c902322a124", "aurora": false, "history": ["http://bit.ly/1PKhRSu"]}, "landing": "http://act.greenpeace.in/freedomofspeech/?utm_campaign=Legitimacy&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=post&utm_term=Banner", "key": "0d9c1b004646651e10874c902322a124", "petition": {"cc": "IN", "basket": "greenpeace", "issue": "india free speech"}}], "images": [{"source": "https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xta1/v/t1.0-9/11245506_10152865616997844_4127805125406240673_n.jpg?oh=009d12198cc3e8ea0590673d437da395&oe=5605C08C&__gda__=1438985921_644344a86a3ab106445a223d6032aab9", "height": 840, "width": 840}, {"source": "https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/11245506_10152865616997844_4127805125406240673_n.jpg?oh=11a72c80035d3b52ec93dbbc0cfc1f14&oe=55F32526&__gda__=1443125047_49a3ef2f8c0b9fecedc598577d4f3d5d", "height": 720, "width": 720}, {"source": "https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p600x600/11245506_10152865616997844_4127805125406240673_n.jpg?oh=be6038d873737447f666d17a389739f5&oe=55F380BC&__gda__=1443728557_56ec859f098a844be60fbc15f4444acb", "height": 600, "width": 600}, {"source": "https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p480x480/11245506_10152865616997844_4127805125406240673_n.jpg?oh=46d3cf37e56ac9cce2134865c6091c29&oe=55FD2E86&__gda__=1443376791_069032a3cc5b2460a1c9e93c87eb46f4", "height": 480, "width": 480}, {"source": "https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p320x320/11245506_10152865616997844_4127805125406240673_n.jpg?oh=d3e19c3293923fec9192d4d67fb62402&oe=560BAFC4&__gda__=1442806229_d56d945df2a53c4a54c5fc371a922ef5", "height": 320, "width": 320}, {"source": "https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/11245506_10152865616997844_4127805125406240673_n.jpg?oh=6d751f667068ea03a27bbcba579d100c&oe=5608A5E1&__gda__=1439018480_8808eb7fafcca41997336699ec126502", "height": 540, "width": 540}, {"source": "https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p130x130/11245506_10152865616997844_4127805125406240673_n.jpg?oh=0cd6fe98d11e1969f8aad66d6f0d5db9&oe=55FDCED4&__gda__=1443292101_ec258bf4e3486728b9bdda41aae578f8", "height": 130, "width": 130}, {"source": "https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p75x225/11245506_10152865616997844_4127805125406240673_n.jpg?oh=f163226db8c634f8b3736b9c77d80bad&oe=56007FAA&__gda__=1442751189_28151a8ca9c29528aa26f07d05ec833e", "height": 225, "width": 225}], "total": {"new": 15.8774373259, "months": {"11": 32, "10": 26, "12": 145, "1": 199, "3": 59, "2": 82, "5": 30, "4": 37, "7": 28, "6": 32, "9": 26, "8": 22}, "reeng": {"10": 444, "1": 114, "3": 47, "2": 9, "5": 36, "4": 14, "7": 14, "6": 13, "9": 19, "8": 8}, "month": 27.7158774373}, "id": "10152865616997844"}
