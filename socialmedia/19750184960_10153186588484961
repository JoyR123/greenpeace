This demonstration was part of Greenpeace\u2019s initiative to raise awareness and strengthen coastal communities by standing together to oppose drilling for oil in the Arctic. \n\nFollowing President Barack Obama\u2019s announcement last week that opened exploration and drilling in the Arctic, Shell has began transporting its oil-spill-containment vessel Arctic Challenger through the Inside Passage en route to the Aleutian Peninsula in Alaska. The rig is currently under-tow by American tug Corbin Foss, passing north of Haida Gwaii through Siiwaay (Dixon Entrance)."}
