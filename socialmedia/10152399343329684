That's because that's the way the infrastructure is designed (for vehicles). Oil industry has their greedy little hands in everything. There should be more buses and trains and new construction should be made safer for walking and biking. But that's not the way things are designed yet. That doesn't mean we should sit around and just let the oil industry destroy what they want. Drilling in the arctic is insane and they know there's no way to clean it up.
