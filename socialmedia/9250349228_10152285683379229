The single biggest cause of climate change, polluted water sources, deforestation, coral reef deaths, destruction of whole habitats and ecosystems including fish populations is the intensive production and slaughter of 80 billion land animals every year and overfishing worldwide. Meat-eating has further destructive implications, like wolf and coyote hunting in the US by cattle ranchers, and the rounding up and slaughter of wild mustangs by the same people. And the stupidest thing is that there is no need for any of it; we don't need to eat meat to be healthy and happy. Greenpeace could make a massive change by encouraging that one thing and showing people ways of doing it with even less impact. I'm also studying for a degree in Zoology and English as a mature student, so I can write about wildlife, ecology and conservation.", "id": "10152280589524229_10152285699159229", "user_likes": false}]}}
