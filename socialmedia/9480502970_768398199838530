And as chance would have it, Premier O'Farrell is bringing his next Cabinet meeting to the public in Casula. There will be an opportunity to hear from you about the issues you are concerned about. \n\nYou can help create real, positive change for your community. Join dozens of concerned citizens next Monday and show your support for Cash for Containers.\n\nWhat: NSW Government cabinet meeting\nWhere: Bella Fonte Events Centre Comfort Inn Hunts Liverpool Hotel, 8 York St Casula\nWhen: 6:30-8pm, Monday 7 April 2014\n\nBefore attending, you\u2019ll need to fill out this form online >> http://bit.ly/1jujpTO\n\nWe\u2019ll have a presence out the front of the entrance to the Comfort Inn from 5pm and will be wearing distinctive t-shirts so please come and say hello before you go into the meeting. \n\nOnce you\u2019re at the meeting there are two things you can do:\n- Give a big clap (or cheer!) to people who ask Premier O\u2019Farrell to support Cash for Containers. \n- If you're feeling brave, get up and ask your own question about when the NSW Government will support Cash for Containers. Be sure to mention you are from the local area and perhaps give an example of a local area where there\u2019s rubbish that would benefit from a Cash for Containers scheme\n\nThis is a critical time for the campaign. You could really help us in the battle against litter and improve recycling rates."}
