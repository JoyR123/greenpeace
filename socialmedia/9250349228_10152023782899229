Due to the systems in place we are all reliant on energy from carbon emission directly and indirectly no matter how much we want to reduce our carbon footprint and for the record I do not own a car because I do not need one, but I do not judge those who do. \n\nI think the problem with those who want to raise awareness about climate change is that they often come across preachy and condescending and they are instantly discredited if they are not 100% green.  I propose that instead of arguing about which side is right or wrong we approach the issue with a little more diplomacy, we find a common ground on which decisions can be made. We can all agree that cleaner and cheaper renewable energy is a good thing, and that biodiversity loss, deforestation and melting ice caps are bad things.  Let's build on that.", "id": "10152022167429229_10152023964064229", "user_likes": false}]}}
