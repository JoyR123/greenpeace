This could see us being sued for banning mining \u2013 or even for taking meaningful action on climate change. \n\nIn December,  Climate Change Ministers Simon Bridges  and Tim Groser will be in  Lima for the international climate change talks (UNFCCC).   There, we expect our Government to do its usual job of undermining the talks, and using the so-called \u201clack of action\u201d from others as an excuse for not strengthening our own climate policies at home. \n\nHEALTH & SAFETY TIPS \n\nSome people have expressed concern about health risks, especially for children, from putting your head in a hole, risks like getting sand in eyes, etc. \n\nHere is some advice that they used at the very successful Bondi beach action: \n\nDig a big hole, much bigger than your head, so you have plenty of room.  If you want, put a towel in the bottom to make it even more comfortable. \n\nIf you need help, call \"holy moly! and someone in a hi viz vest will appear with a spade to help you make the hole big enough.  \n\nKneel in front of hole, put weight on elbows each side of hole and lower head. Be prepared to stay like that for a couple of minutes.\n\nIf you have problems, pull your head out of hole! \n\nOur hi viz people will also have water on hand (but good to bring your own), so please call out to them if you're having any problems.  \n\nParents please supervise children.\n\nADVISORY FOR ORGANISERS\n\nWhen you get your local organising group together, here is what you need to do:\n\n- choose a popular and accessible beach, set time (check tides) - most people doing on or around 12 noon;\n- choose at least 2 marshalls with hi viz, spades and fresh water to help people;\n- find someone trained in first aid who will be there;\n- find a loud whistle to give the signal to put heads in hole (message: blowing the whistle on the govt's \"heads in the sand\" attitude to climate change) and agree who will blow it and when; this person or someone else should then get a body count - we want to add them all up nationally;\n- organise 2 photographers who will focus just on getting good pics for media\n     - if you are having a speaker organise a sound system;\n- make or find some relevant banners - keep them simple and relevant to the issue - we are going after the govt here, the relevant image is that they have their heads in the sand. One single message is most effective.  Logos of organisations who are supporting are welcome;\n- draft a press release for local media and nominate a spokesperson  who will have a cell phone at the event and afterwards. We will do media for the national level and share with you a day or so before) but great to get something in your local paper or radio station. Get the story with a count of people present plus one or more good photos to your local paper asap after the event. Sunday afternoon is a good time for media - journos are working then.\n- create a Facebook page with time and place and instructions, and let Tim Jones (tjonescan@gmail.com) know so he can link to it from our page;\n- email all your members, supporters, contacts with the info and the link;\n- HAVE FUN!"}
