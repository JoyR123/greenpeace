We are supporting the locals in their court case against the coal company. They are harvesting as many olives as they can even though it's the wrong season.\n\nHere is Captain Peter Willcox's perspective:\n\"Yirca\nYesterday we went to meet some people who are trying to save their village from being destroyed by the Kolin Construction Company.\nYirca is near Soma, where hundreds of miners lost their lives in a coal mine fire in May. The official toll was 301, but we were told the number is much greater. In between Yirca and Soma there exist already a large coal burning power plant. The big stack looks to be over 200 meters high.\nLast week, in the middle of the night, the coal company sent three bulldozers to knock down the olive trees belonging to the villagers. The olive grove stands in the way of the construction of the new coal fired power plant. The villagers met the bulldozers, and after 13 trees were knocked down managed to turn them back.\nWe got to the village, and met with the mayor and a number of people. We all had tea. Yirca reminds me of Mallorca, where I lived several years ago. Stone and concrete block building with red tile roofs. There are about 150 residents, making it about the same size as Village Creek, the co-op in Norwalk, CT where I grew up and later spent several years raising my daughters, Anita and Natasha.\nAfter tea, we were taken down to the olive grove. It\u2019s a grove of fairly young trees, averaging 15 years old. Most stood about five meters (15\u2019) tall. The bulldozers had no trouble knocking them down; fortunately, they did not want to tackle the people. We went over to the corner of the grove where people were working. The olives are not ripe yet, they need two to three more months. But the villagers are scared that if Kolin Company comes again in the night they will lose everything and are harvesting early. As a result they will be lucky to realize 25% of what the harvest usually brings.\nKolin has offered them the approximate amount of money they would get from one year\u2019s harvest. For olive trees that can last hundreds of years.\nIt was a community operation. One of our crew, Rossano who studied agriculture at university and owns a small farm in Portugal, explained what was going on. Parents were raking the olives out of the trees and pruning the branches back. In Mallorca, they have special machines to shake the trees, and knock all the ripe olives to the ground, where they are caught in tarps. No machines here, they use long fingered rakes to knock the olives down. They still use tarps. The teenagers were doing their part by riding by on their motor bikes. Nothing unusual there.\nTalking to the oldest farmer, you could see that he was upset. The olive grove represents about 80% of the income of the village. No olive grove, no village.\nWe were next taken to the ashes of the existing coal power plant. There are two small ash mountains, small meaning 150 meters high. The whole area, which must have measured a half square mile, was a lunar landscape of ash. People go here to find unburnt pieces of coal to sell. The place smells foul. It is less than a half mile from the village. It is no wonder that asthma is so prevalent, especially among children living near coal plants. Soma Coal power plant is the second dirtiest plant in Turkey, responsible for the premature deaths of 1,340 persons in 2010.\nWe went back to the village and were treated to a truly superb supper of warm bread, two type of melon, at least two types of olives, cheese, dolmas, and of course olive oil. Some bowls contained a fresh tomato paste and olive oil. You would dip in your bread for some of the tomato, and get the oil as well. One of the green olives had fresh lemon squeezed on top, something I have got to remember to try. We were all contentedly groaning as we got up.\nAfter dinner we gathered in a large circle in a yard. The idea was to share knowledge. The men sat in chairs in the circle. An equal number of women stood outside the circle. I was glad to see they were not bashful about asking questions, making statements and taking part. I said a few lines of the company spiel. Rossano was eloquent in talking about how things were changing in his village in Portugal. He talked about how people worked together on community projects: everything from insulating each other\u2019s houses to putting up solar panels. And he pointed out that things had already changed when the villagers decided to reject the second (and proposed third) coal plant.\nGreenpeace has provided a full time lawyer, who is spending her time in Soma, fighting off the destruction of the olive grove, and the building of the second plant. We have also provided a full time community activist named Resit. Resit reminds me of a campaigner I met in India years ago named Nity. Gp is doing some truly excellent work here. A woman named Zeina has taken over as E.D.,of the Greenpeace Akdeniz - T\u00fcrkiye and I think it is safe to expect a lot more of this in the future.\nAfter the meeting, many of the villagers headed back to sleep in the grove. They are expecting the bulldozers to come back. We headed back to the ship. If we were able to provide some small amount of encouragement to these folks, then we did a good thing. I am sure that it was us who benefited most. I first came to Turkey 18 years ago to protest another coal fired power plant. Now Turkey has a plan to build 60 more coal fired plants. Despite all the efforts of Greenpeace and others, it feels like we are going backwards. But I take heart in knowing that no European country would ever dream of building another coal fired plant. And here in Turkey is a tiny village that has had enough. Enough lies, enough bad health, enough of getting kicked around by an industrial conglomerate partnered with the government.\nEveryone should be real clear that coal kills. It kills the miners. It kills people living near the plants. It kills the fish in the seas- the more coal we burn, the more CO2 we put in the atmosphere, the more acidic the oceans become. Australian marine scientists suggest that within 25 years the oceans will be too acid to grow corals, and other lime based shells.\nTurkey is rich in solar and wind power. Large windmills can be seen on the ridges of this mountainous area now. Solar hot water was already in extensive use on my first visit. There are options to coal. But the petroleum and coal industries are among the richest in the world - they are not going to go quietly.\nThis tour has includes a mind-numbing number of open days and one action. I am sure the crew came away feeling vitalized and energized by meeting the people of Yirca. They are why we are here.\"", "total": {"new": 9.4161958569, "months": {"1": 116, "3": 83, "2": 104, "5": 53, "4": 67, "7": 20, "6": 32, "9": 27, "8": 29}, "reeng": {"10": 328, "1": 50, "3": 33, "2": 18, "5": 23, "4": 15, "7": 14, "6": 20, "9": 15, "8": 15}, "month": 21.8455743879}, "type": "photo", "id": "106859899530_10152467772864531", "petition": null, "comments": {"months": {"1": 3, "8": 1, "3": 3, "2": 6}, "reeng": {"1": 2, "10": 8, "3": 2, "5": 1}, "month": 23.0769230769, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTM=", "before": "MTM="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/106859899530_10152467772864531/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=883483195046454|9nfpAUxoDRMZ77lLiQ83CrnaV3s&after=MTM%3D"}, "new": 15.3846153846, "summary": {"total_count": 13, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "10152831058817647", "name": "Suzanne Camejo"}, "like_count": 8, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-09-20T08:58:40+0000", "message": "Big Coal is our enemy and everyone's enemy especially the Planet's", "id": "10152467772864531_10152467922824531", "user_likes": false}]}}
