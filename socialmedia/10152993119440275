Over time these weeds have become resistant to glyphosate and grown hardier. In turn some farmers have resorted to spraying more of the pesticide to try to kill the tougher \u201csuper weeds\u201d.\n\nGenetic engineering\u2019s early promise to reduce pesticide use now seems empty. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently reported that herbicide use doubled\u2014from 62 million pounds in 1996 to 128 million pounds in 2012.  Glyphosate now represents more than 83 percent of the chemical pesticides used in the U.S. annually.\n\nThe IARC study was published April 23, as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was considering approving GE seeds of corn and soybeans engineered to withstand 2,4-D, a suspected carcinogen. If the EPA approves the new GE seeds and if 2,4-D is used to kill weeds on some of the 170 million acres of corn and soybeans grown in the U.S. annually, the USDA estimates that 2,4-D use is likely to triple, dramatically increasing people\u2019s exposure to a pesticide that may cause cancer.Read more:\nhttp://netzfrauen.org/2015/02/06/studie-pestizide-von-monsanto-verdoppelt-das-lymphdruesenkrebs-risiko-non-hodgkin-lymphom-study-glyphosate-doubles-risk-lymphoma/", "id": "10152993119440275_10152995779820275", "user_likes": false}]}, "height": 494, "created_time": "2015-02-04T23:44:31+0000", "width": 496, "edge": "objects", "likes": {"months": {"11": 84, "10": 75, "12": 530, "1": 96, "3": 128, "2": 110, "5": 127, "4": 137, "7": 93, "6": 102, "9": 72, "8": 102}, "reeng": {"10": 1388, "1": 63, "3": 68, "2": 5, "5": 33, "4": 5, "7": 40, "6": 8, "9": 33, "8": 13}, "month": 5.7971014493, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "ODk5OTE3Mjg2NzE4NDgz", "before": "ODk5OTE3Mjg2NzE4NDgz"}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/10152993119440275/likes?access_token=192154930871376%7CUId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&pretty=0&summary=1&limit=1&after=ODk5OTE3Mjg2NzE4NDgz"}, "new": 3.8043478261, "summary": {"total_count": 1667}, "data": [{"id": "899917286718483", "name": "Lucero Vertiz"}]}, "urls": [], "images": [{"source": "https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10982452_10152993119440275_3474418491443552704_n.jpg?oh=0ed5741d8aaca9aa4ee632ceea82c994&oe=5609EA00&__gda__=1439265151_3349a706d0a533ed08f67e8d16ccff88", "height": 494, "width": 496}, {"source": "https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/p480x480/10982452_10152993119440275_3474418491443552704_n.jpg?oh=c38e301e64c9044da5cc4fbbf624a4d9&oe=55F8400A&__gda__=1439138076_1ecec02c8ccf7eadb274955ed8e99a02", "height": 480, "width": 481}, {"source": "https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/p320x320/10982452_10152993119440275_3474418491443552704_n.jpg?oh=aa28446eb9f3c4ced2c0f6ac2bc5e7a0&oe=55C0E548&__gda__=1442959198_ca7dbf22ea4eeb8a23c3fd2a19bb340d", "height": 320, "width": 321}, {"source": "https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/p130x130/10982452_10152993119440275_3474418491443552704_n.jpg?oh=f468daca08c85bdd721af1d5dc3cd66d&oe=5601EE58&__gda__=1442489166_e25b9c7c46b28d2d84a239da674fff80", "height": 130, "width": 130}, {"source": "https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/p75x225/10982452_10152993119440275_3474418491443552704_n.jpg?oh=43e409ecc736acd0ca94187ba9c66705&oe=56031D26&__gda__=1439072909_29496f12ff1b09a6ae178fc0f6039c9b", "height": 225, "width": 225}], "total": {"new": 3.9133052378, "months": {"11": 85, "10": 75, "12": 531, "1": 98, "3": 129, "2": 110, "5": 127, "4": 137, "7": 93, "6": 102, "9": 72, "8": 102}, "reeng": {"10": 1391, "1": 65, "3": 68, "2": 5, "5": 33, "4": 5, "7": 40, "6": 8, "9": 33, "8": 13}, "month": 5.9000602047}, "id": "10152993119440275"}
