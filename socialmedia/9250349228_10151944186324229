Yesterday, the government's department for energy announced plans to close a loophole that would have allowed old coal power stations to apply for billions of pounds of your money. \n\nThe announcement centres around cash that would have been doled out through the so-called 'capacity market'. Here's how it works:\n\nThe capacity market is a scheme, set up by government, that allows power stations to apply for public subsidies.\n\nSupposedly created with the intention of subsidising gas-fired power plants to provide back up for renewables, the scheme has been opened up to coal too, meaning that some of UK's highest-emitting power stations could receive millions to stay open.\n\nAfter a Greenpeace investigation revealed that some coal power stations could be eligible for extra long contracts of up to 15 years of funding, government officials agreed to change the policy. \n\nThis is a great result, but still the UK continues to generate around 36% of its electricity from coal, and shockingly could still plough millions of pounds of energy bill payers' cash into keeping coal power stations open. \n\nHere's the full story >>> http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/aug/01/old-coal-subsidy-loophole-to-be-closed-by-uk-government", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"1": 71, "3": 167, "2": 176, "5": 164, "4": 170, "7": 180, "6": 161, "8": 392}, "reeng": {"10": 1247, "3": 12, "2": 61, "5": 23, "4": 42, "7": 22, "6": 35, "9": 20, "8": 19}, "month": 4.7940580689}, "type": "photo", "id": "9250349228_10151944186324229", "petition": null, "comments": {"months": {"1": 6, "3": 9, "2": 2, "5": 5, "4": 3, "7": 2, "6": 2, "8": 8}, "reeng": {"10": 26, "2": 6, "5": 1, "6": 4}, "month": 16.2162162162, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "Mzc=", "before": "Mzc="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/9250349228_10151944186324229/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=Mzc%3D"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 37, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "364140430456638", "name": "Paul Wedlock"}, "like_count": 49, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-08-02T22:23:40+0000", "message": "Invest in Solar panels and Geothermal Heat Exchanges\u2665\u2665\nKEEP your Carbon emissions\nUnderground!", "id": "10151942810779229_10151944955594229", "user_likes": false}]}}
