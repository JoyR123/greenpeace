And as humans were not wired to make world changing choices cause usually we make the wrong one so I hope the conspiracy theory's aren't true about things like harp but let's be real if the choice was given to man kind power would take over and the choice would be made and it would be the mistake to end all mistakes none of us should have the right to say who lives and who dies I guess there's a lot more to save then just the polar bears the arctic is just one of many things that are going to be destroyed by bad choices think of it this way all that ice melts the water has to go somewhere and if it's evolution and were coming out of an ice age then even still we must start figuring out what were gonna do either way man kind is making there bed I just hope were all ready to fight for it to be on a 1000 thread count...
