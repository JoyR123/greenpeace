We have been fighting the Eagle Mine near Marquette for years because of it's close proximity to Lake Superior but these big corporations somehow seem to get their way 9 times out of 10. The Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, a band of the Ojibwa Nation, have spent millions of dollars fighting to keep this mine out. A number of other organizations have fought, for years yet the mine comes. Years ago, corporations purchased the mineral rights for thousands of acres of land from the state governments and now they've come to collect on their investments. There are environmental laws to protect these precious and life giving lands and waters but these corporations simply buy their exemptions from our government officials, create a few jobs, do their dirty work , make a bundle of money and leave. They destroy our precious wilderness, poison it and leave. When they leave so do the jobs. Some residents want the jobs but others know that the cost of those jobs is simply too high in the long run. Please join in the fight and help protect the Bad River Watershed. Water is right up there with air when it comes to our survival on this planet!", "id": "10152596530784684_10152599112264684", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2014, 7, 17, 0], "full_picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAt0Xlkt-fvAHFZ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fupw-prod-images.global.ssl.fastly.net%2Fnugget%2F53bc168c1d9f3ff76d00004e%2Fmine-mrill-2-abc72b7321a3a57da3271584c1cd8f2d.jpg", "caption": "upworthy.com", "edge": "posts", "link": "http://www.upworthy.com/they-know-an-alien-invasion-when-they-see-it-and-theyre-putting-up-a-fight?c=c%3Dgp1", "shares": {"count": 551}, "urls": [], "created_time": "2014-07-17T00:00:00+0000", "message": "An out-of-state mining company wants to dig what could be the world's largest open-pit iron mine near some of the world's most pristine water.
