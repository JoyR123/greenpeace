It is ludicrous that this forest is being cleared to make way for the Whitehaven's Maules Creek Coal Mine project. While the local community  including the Gomeroi people have tried every legal avenue possible to stop this mine from going ahead, their calls have fallen on deaf ears. 100's of activists have now visited the Leard State Forest blockade camp to help. The blockade camp has been in position for over 500 days, and more activists are needed up there to help, especially now that the bulldozers have moved in! In the mean time, we want to tell Sydney siders what Whitehaven is doing, but holding this vigil for the Leard State Forest and protest against Whitehaven's dirty work. We invite you to spread this message far and wide and come with as many friends as you can muster! This is a significant new coal mine that must be stopped! Lets tell Whitehaven we don't want them in our State Forest!"}
