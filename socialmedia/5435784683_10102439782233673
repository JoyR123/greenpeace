That is what they stand for. They have no one forcing them to tone down their vigor. On the other hand, many of us also realize that the Obama 'YES WE CAN genuine guy' who had our hopes up, met with a rude awakening when he actually won the presidency. You can't fight city hall, which means literally, you can't fight the money and power behind it in our current political climate. Obama tried like hell on the health bill (his original one). His intention had to surrender. He has tried to move the energy trend to renewables, instead he had to settle just to get the \"theme\" started moving in the right direction. Anyone who actually believes that the president can just do whatever the hell he wants, needs to spend some time within the reality of politics, study, watch the documentaries, do some homework, go back and study the Kennedy assassination - a president who thought he was the president! In Washington, it CAN come down to just staying alive. Give Obama a break and give Greenpeace a break. They are both doing the best they can GIVEN the parameters of their situations. If we don't like the manipulation of our politicians, if we don't like the big money lobbyist taking charge of Washington politics, then we need to stop being lazy as a citizenry. We need to stop blaming THEM and do something. At least Greenpeace is DOING SOMETHING, or trying to do something, which is more than most of us in the peanut gallery.", "id": "10102439782233673_22061317", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2014, 1, 31, 4], "full_picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQBwFY8adcFHioAY&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgreenpeaceblogs.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2013%2F06%2FMountRushmore.jpg", "caption": "greenpeaceblogs.org", "edge": "posts", "link": "http://bit.ly/1fmCa8Y", "shares": {"count": 141}, "urls": [], "created_time": "2014-01-31T04:30:01+0000", "message": "Take the quiz now to find out which part of President Barack Obama's State of the Union speech was written by the oil industry.\n\n#SOTU #SOTUChat", "total": {"new": 7.5129533679, "months": {"1": 386}, "reeng": {"10": 262, "1": 29, "3": 15, "2": 5, "5": 18, "4": 11, "7": 14, "6": 9, "9": 16, "8": 7}, "month": 100.0}, "type": "link", "id": "5435784683_10102439782233673", "description": "The answer is quite surprising."}
