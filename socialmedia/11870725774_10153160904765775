Our sons first demonstration was supporting the Arctic30 and he was very upset that those who try to stop oil drilling would be in jail instead of those who drill. Yesterday it was great for him to meet one of the people who were imprisoned. When Ana Paula on top of that thanked him and said that she\u2019d perhaps still been in prison without him, he was flabbergasted. He saw very concretely how he can have an influence. Then he made a drawing where two people think \"no oil in the sea\" and the third person thinks of a sea and a boat (the Arctic Sunrise). Again, thanks for all you do and thank you for this experience!\u201d\n\nhttp://grnpc.org/Igeg0"}
