Take a stand for clean water and an end to dirty coal ash polluting North Carolina! \n\nDuke Energy needs to clean up the coal ash from the Feb. 2 Dan River spill and at all of the ash impoundments across NC. Coal ash is hazardous waste produced by coal-fired power plants and constitutes a toxic mix of heavy metals, chemicals, and known carcinogens. We won't stand for coal ash to be dumped in our rivers and lakes or slowly released into drinking water sources! \n\nWe'll deliver over 8,500 petitions pressing Duke to clean up its coal ash at all 14 plants in NC. Speakers during the petition delivery represent this issue from the national to local scale.\n\nIf you are looking for transportation from the Asheville area, please contact emma.greenbaum@sierraclub.org for info!"}
