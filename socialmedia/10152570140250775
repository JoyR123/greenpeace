Not the Arctic as well! Oil companies have brought misery and destruction to many of the places they operate. At least the damage is observable in populated areas and therefore can be monitored. How much filth will they be able to spew out if there is no one around to report the damage? There will be no brakes on their greed and lack of concern for consequences. Shareholders want their money so what do they care if pristine environments are destroyed? Shell executives get paid bonuses if they increase shareholder profits. Simple really but a very simplistic and vile economic system. \nI am disappointed that a Danish company can go along with this as Denmark is highly regarded as a country with a reputation for social conscious. \nI began playing with Lego in 1964 - we were lucky eought to have had recent immigrants from Netherlands for neighbours. I also enjoyed sharing time with my son building with Lego back in the 90s. This move by Lego has tarnished my memories of my many years of playing with their product.
