Now at Cnr Russell and Edmonstone St, West End (Musgrave Park). Due to number of people saying they're attending, we've had to upgrade :)\n\nWe will have people at the original location ready to direct people to our new starting point. It is less than 5 minutes walk.\n\n-----\n\nOur environment is under attack like never before with forests being logged, Indigenous land being violated and wildlife being culled.\n\nNow, the Great Barrier Reef has been put under the firing line as the government toadies up to the thoughtless greed of the mining magnates like Gina Rinehardt, who want to pollute our Great Barrier Reef.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef is one of the wonders of world, and also host to a range of protected species including endangered marine turtles and dugongs. The Reef is simply too precious for us to lose.\n\nMeanwhile, our government is busy giving tax breaks to coal barons, while getting ready to cut essential services, health, welfare and education. They've also made themselves busy in approving horrendous destruction in the Leard State Forest, and plan to strip Tasmanian wilderness of heritage protection.\n\nThis is not a government concerned with people or planet and we cannot let our planet be ruined this way.\n\nSpeakers confirmed:\n- Boe Spearim, Brisbane Aboriginal Sovereign Embassy\n- June Norman, Veteran environmental activist\n- Larissa Waters, Greens Senator\n- Melanie Thomas, Pirate Party candidate for Griffith\n- Annette Maybon-Hutchins, StopCSGBrisbane\n- Ewan Saunders, Socialist Alliance\n\nTHIS SATURDAY IS THE GRIFFITH BY-ELECTION. Let's send a strong message to politicians from all parties, saying that dumping on the Reef is not going to happen on our watch!\n\nSo join us this Saturday, at 1pm at the corners of Russell St & Boundary St, West End (The Lizard sculpture) demonstrating against these attacks on our environment and the Great Barrier Reef. --- Please note, the starting point may change due to capacity. All venue changes will be via Facebook.\n\nOrganised by:\nAustralian Student Environment Network\n\nEndorsed by:\nFriends of the Earth Brisbane\nGreenpeace\nStopCSGBris\nThe Greens\nSocialist Alliance\nResistance\nThe Pirate Party\n\nEVENTS IN OTHER CITIES:\n\nSYDNEY:  \nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/524892144275778/\nMELBOURNE: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/522553881196368\nADELAIDE:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/743855055625680/\nPERTH:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/257618287733224/"}
