They came up with the design for these posters and asked me to draw their vision. They were upset that, as the future generation, they had no say and no one wanted to listen to them as they are just kids. They feel a true connection to the dolphins and wanted to capture all these ideas in the poster.  I drew up these two drawings with much constructive criticism from them both. - Luccamina\u201d\n\n\u25b6 Sign The Petition Here: http://grnpc.org/save-our-mauis-dolphin \n\nThe Maui's dolphin only lives in New Zealand waters and it is critically endangered - under threat from fishing, oil drilling and seismic testing. Unless we give it proper protection, New Zealand could be the first country to cause the extinction of a dolphin species since China's Yangtze River dolphin went extinct.", "total": {"new": 6.2780269058, "months": {"11": 14, "10": 20, "12": 172, "1": 49, "3": 23, "2": 36, "5": 32, "4": 27, "7": 16, "6": 16, "9": 20, "8": 21}, "reeng": {"10": 351, "1": 28, "3": 11, "2": 12, "5": 7, "4": 8, "7": 9, "6": 5, "9": 5, "8": 10}, "month": 10.9865470852}, "type": "photo", "id": "11870725774_10153391144640775", "petition": null, "comments": {"months": {"1": 4, "12": 10, "2": 5, "7": 1}, "reeng": {"1": 4, "10": 11, "3": 3, "2": 1, "5": 1}, "month": 20.0, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MjE=", "before": "MjE="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/11870725774_10153391144640775/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=MjE%3D"}, "new": 20.0, "summary": {"total_count": 21, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "10205601448890709", "name": "Nick Young"}, "like_count": 3, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2015-06-19T01:42:42+0000", "message": "Powerful stuff.", "id": "10153391144640775_10153391152435775", "user_likes": false}]}}
