Is Greenpeace getting to be so big that governments fear them? Is that why India has acted as it has? \nI am glad that the good individual citizens of India have stepped forward. I do wonder whether Greenpeace can learn from this and look at compartmentalising activities via a whole network of closely related organisations rather than one massive organisation that people can point a finger at and claim political agenda, even agenda controlled by foreign powers. Perhaps green peace can consider a number of more focussed areas for 'chapters'. Green power, green food, green land, green sea life, green anti-pollution, green recycling, green... well, you get the idea.", "id": "10153300921270775_10153301549625775", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2015, 5, 17, 1], "full_picture": "https://fbcdn-vthumb-a.akamaihd.net/hvthumb-ak-xfa1/v/t15.0-10/s720x720/11114553_10152467839924229_1833003775_n.jpg?oh=45f1d7857061423548dec192938b99c1&oe=562CEF58&__gda__=1445417224_2069243230cbf855d86f82b5decc1e77", "edge": "posts", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/greenpeaceuk/videos/10152467819679229/", "likes": {"months": {"11": 14, "10": 6, "12": 68, "1": 16, "3": 15, "2": 13, "5": 13, "4": 15, "7": 12, "6": 15, "9": 6, "8": 15}, "reeng": {"10": 183, "1": 5, "3": 4, "2": 3, "5": 6, "4": 1, "7": 3, "6": 1, "9": 2}, "month": 7.6923076923, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTQwMzYwMTExNjYyMjY0NA==", "before": "MTQwMzYwMTExNjYyMjY0NA=="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/11870725774_10153300921270775/likes?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=MTQwMzYwMTExNjYyMjY0NA%3D%3D"}, "new": 2.4038461538, "summary": {"total_count": 213}, "data": [{"id": "1403601116622644", "name": "Ben Harris"}]}, "urls": [], "created_time": "2015-05-17T01:48:07+0000", "total": {"new": 2.358490566, "months": {"11": 14, "10": 6, "12": 70, "1": 16, "3": 16, "2": 13, "5": 13, "4": 15, "7": 12, "6": 15, "9": 6, "8": 16}, "reeng": {"10": 186, "1": 5, "3": 4, "2": 3, "5": 6, "4": 2, "7": 3, "6": 1, "9": 2}, "month": 7.5471698113}, "type": "video", "id": "11870725774_10153300921270775", "description": "WATCH: Since authorities blocked Greenpeace India\u2019s bank accounts, ordinary Indians have been saying #ISupportGreenpeaceIndia and showing their support.\n\nWe need free speech to protect the environment, so our colleagues hung a huge banner on their offices.\n\nPlease SHARE the video to spread the word!"}
