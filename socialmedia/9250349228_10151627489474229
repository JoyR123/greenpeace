This is simply Tory ideology at work, it is central to everything they believe and stand for to exploit people and planet alike for their own gain. They are as likely to reconsider their position on fracking as they are on free market economics. It's timer to stop fighting fires and to actively work on stopping the fire-starters. Unless we are working to address the root causes; growth at all costs, capitalism, conservatism, party politics, etc., then all is lost. We need radical change, not begging letters. Revolution, not requests. Be bold and brave. Organise! Resist! If you really want to stop fracking get up to Barton Moss Community Protection Camp and take a stand there.", "id": "10151627483374229_8557099", "user_likes": false}]}}
