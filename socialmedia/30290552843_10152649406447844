The active ingredient in the most widely used herbicide is glyphosate, while some herbicides contain 2,4D. #2,4D is best known as a component of #AgentOrange, a defoliant widely employed during the Vietnam War. Until the introduction of GM crops about 20 years ago, herbicides were sprayed on fields before planting, and then only sparingly used around crops.
