In 2012 a report released by the Stockholm International Water Institute stated that: \u201cWith 70% of all available water being in agriculture, growing more food to feed an additional 2 billion people by 2050 will place greater pressure on available water and land.\u201d The report also said: \u201cNine hundred million people already go hungry and 2 billion people are malnourished in spite of the fact that per capita food production continues to increase.\u201d\n\nConsumption of animal products does not merely use resources, it depletes them. Sustaining a meat, dairy and egg-eating culture requires at least 17 times more land, 14 times more water, and from 10 to 20 times more consumption of fossil fuels and other energy sources, than would be required to sustain a purely vegan culture of the same size. Cattle need nearly 4.5 times the amount of water to produce an equivalent tonnage of wheat, making the beef or dairy cow the most water-intensive animal to sustain. Poultry comes in a close second, requiring over 3.5 times the amount of water needed for wheat. Raising animals for food requires so much water that you could leave your shower on 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and not consume more water than someone consuming meat. The land used to grow crops to feed livestock is 10 times what is needed to grow crops for human consumption. Face this fact: Even if 100% of all the land on the six inhabited continents were used for agriculture (including the Sahara desert, Greenland, etc.), and even if that land were as productive as U. S. agricultural land, there would still not be enough land to feed the world population if our diet continues to comprise of animal products. even maintaining a small minority of the world\u2019s citizens on the typical U.S diet will not be possible for very much longer. If resources are not conserved, everyone in the long run may be equal but starve. And in fact, what promotes social injustice in the first place? Owners of large tracts of land who are using that land to promote animal-based or livestock consumption for the elite. Regardless of social system, any country \u2014 rich or poor \u2014 that emphasizes or maintains livestock production is making its food situation, and that of the world, substantially worse.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-CmV92Qr-g&list=PL8FjQj3zfdFL8BRhq-EpXjcG0jReQCfyS&", "id": "10152155260797844_10152161877102844", "user_likes": false}]}}
