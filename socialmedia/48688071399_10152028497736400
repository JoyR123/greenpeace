This is not an isolated case, different nationalities have been arrested in the past for exploiting endangered species. The issue here is not the Chinese but the fact that less than 1% of the world's ocean is protected. We need your help in calling on governments to make sure that oceans sanctuaries are in place.\n\nThere are existing mechanisms in place, that can be implemented, such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) - an international agreement between governments. Its aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival.\n\nAlso, despite limited resources, Greenpeace works hard to look after the marine environment, making sure that oceans' biodiversity is well protected. Harvesting turtles anywhere on the planet, and for whatever purpose, is something that we and other environmental/conservationist groups have long condemned, as we condemn harvesting of various other endangered species.", "id": "10152028459201400_10152028910726400", "user_likes": false}]}}
