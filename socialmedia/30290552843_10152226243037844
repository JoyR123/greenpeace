The below mentioned link is of a page named \"SAVE Mother EARTH\" which has been started by me and my father which tends to address various atrocities being carried out on our Mother Earth. The one which has come to our mind right now is relating to the illegal usage of conventional RED BRICKS which are harming our beloved land in numerous ways. One of the outcomes of the same might be that we don't get cereals to eat in India domestically and might have to live on imported cereals. This is just one of the many problems. Please look into the matter and promote our page, and help us in increasing awareness about such deeds.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/SAVE-Mother-EARTH/865552650140392?fref=ts\n\nWe are trying to reach out to as many people as possible. Our intentions are pretty clear and we are ready to work hard through our page against such disastrous activities. Please help us promote our page.\n\nYour support is required in our mission to Save Mother Earth. \nPlease share this page.\n\nThank You. \n\nUmang Mall", "id": "10152226101107844_10152226513722844", "user_likes": false}]}}
