But this does not mean the mine will go ahead. Carmichael Mine is over 500km from the coast, so it relies on considerable new and expensive infrastructure to become operational. India's Adani Group needs to find the billions of dollars to establish rail access, water and power supplies in the remote region before this mine can be built. That's not even including the cash they need to expand the controversial Abbot Point coal terminal on the edge of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. Considering the current coal price, which has plummeted to a record low of $70 (Carmichael needs a coal price of at least $100 to make the mine feasible), we know that Adani will struggle to raise the finance to build Carmichael Mine. \"\n \nThe The Sydney Morning Herald - smh.com.au reported \"The sustained weakness in thermal coal prices over the past three years has played havoc with the prospective economics of the project. Several industry majors have scaled back production ambitions as they have sought to slash costs to maintain viability. Last week US coal major Peabody admitted its Australian coal mines were barely profitable as it seeks to continue to cut costs.\"  ", "type": "photo", "is_hidden": false, "status_type": "shared_story", "description": "We\u2019ve only a few days left until Environment Minister Hunt announces his decision on the Carmichael mega coal mine in Queensland\u2019s Galilee Basin: https://www.greenpeace.org.au/action/?cid=70&src=FB12\nThis monster would be seven times the size of Sydney Harbour and would produce enough emissions to eclipse  all the carbon emissions of New Zealand every year!
