Greenpeace has sought a ban on this type of toxic trade and achieved it through an international treaty called the Basel Convention. In 1994, a unique coalition of developing countries, and some from eastern and western Europe along with Greenpeace, managed to pass by consensus what has come to be known as the Basel Ban which banned waste transfer to developing countries.\n\nTwenty-one years after the Philippine government ratified the Basel Convention it continues to labor under the threat of toxic waste trade. With the latest illegal Canadian toxic wastes, the we are continuing our demand for the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to initiate the ratification process of the Basel Ban Amendment to prevent the Philippines from becoming a global toxic waste dump site.", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"10": 108, "1": 27, "3": 20, "2": 14, "5": 15, "4": 26, "7": 35, "6": 17, "9": 45, "8": 21}, "reeng": {"10": 303, "2": 6, "5": 1, "4": 6, "6": 4, "9": 2, "8": 6}, "month": 8.2317073171}, "type": "photo", "id": "48688071399_10152337233706400", "petition": null, "comments": {"months": {"1": 1, "4": 1}, "reeng": {"10": 1, "2": 1}, "month": 50.0, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "Mg==", "before": "Mg=="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/48688071399_10152337233706400/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=Mg%3D%3D"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 2, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "443350179183628", "name": "Luna Eitri"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-10-23T10:38:39+0000", "message": "OT: I hope na ok lang po ito post.
