We are therefore out of touch with reality. Kindness and compassion towards all living things is a mark of a intelligent society. However, all the animals, the plants, the minerals, and even humans, are being broken and reassembled every day, to preserve an elite few (rich people), who are the loudest to theorize on freedom, but the least free of all. This rich people live, away from their polluting factories, in gated communities (of difficult access and enhanced security), pure air and uncontaminated mineral water. So that wealthy people in much of the world are insulated from the consequences of their actions. Rich men have USELESS material desires. Poor men, Animals and Nature die to make them come true. \nWhen dealing with rich people, remember you are NOT dealing with creatures of logic, but with ignorant creatures motivated by greed, pride and unhealthy vanity.\nThe very lifeblood (or weakness) of a company is its financial stability. The least we can do is boycott their products, push down the price of its shares in the market, deplete their capital and lead them to bankruptcy or to force them to adjust to Nature. Sentiment without action is the ruin of the soul. We live on a planet well able to provide a decent life for all.", "id": "601854653273410_601858946606314", "user_likes": false}]}}
