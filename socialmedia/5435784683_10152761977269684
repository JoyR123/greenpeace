I'm in Seattle WA running a Kickstarter project to bring back sail powered shipping. In the next 5 years, we are planning to build full size ships and start shipping from the West Coast to Hawaii, over to Asia and back to the US. We will use prevailing winds for a substantial reduction in fuel use and emissions. I'm reaching out to everyone, please share this project with your friends. We are live for 23 more days and we have a nice selection of rewards.
