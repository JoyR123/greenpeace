The use of oil and gas has ended really! This new formula works with its new method (Immersion Turbines in depth of sea water in zero resultant forces). Thus in power generation, water does not exit from the dams! This is a new industrial revolution in the world. All the scientists in the world are in the shock now. With this great discovery will solve the problem of global warming too. It is a scientific fact. I found the answer a question of science that hundreds of years, scientists are looking for answers. Now the time has come to say that we could find a new theory to produce clean energy more powerful than atomic energy: \nWhich one is better now (E=mc^2) or (E>P+1at)?! \n(E=mc^2) in physics\n(E>P+1at) in hydropower\nI could prove that (E>P+1at) is very better than (E=mc^2).\nThe answer is very simple. You can investigate and judge. \nToday is the end time of two world wars: 1- Energy world war 2- Climate change world war. The global hardest hydropower question was answered and amazing effect on the climate change! The global hydropower hardest question is: How to get the energy potential of the water level weight in dams and seas? The most advanced answer: The scientific use of the formula (E > P+1at) and the most advanced new method of producing electricity from immersion turbines in depth of seas and oceans water. With amazing discover of a new clean energy formula in depth of water (E>P+1at). The immersion turbine method in depth of sea water is the base of this new model. This invention can change the world and it can start a new industrial revolution in the world. Many scientists believe that the discovery of the formula is unparalleled. Although many still in shock! How this formula has not be discovered by scientists in the world. The project titled (Kurdestan and US clean energy coordination) runs in cooperation with the United States introduced. Of course, this beautiful project after the National Hydropower Association 2015 conference is done in the United States. This invention is patented in Department of Justice in Kurdestan of Iraq No. 952/6 on 12/6/2013. Now all countries can benefit from that if they are Kurdestan partners and businesses in this new clean energy method. You can read the articles of (Change the world with Kurdistan\u2019s industrial revolution) and (A Kurdish inventor has found a new method for electricity production under water). \n\nFor more information you can speak more about it with: \nMr. Dr. Sherko Jawdat (Head of Energy & Natural Resources Committee of Parliament of Kurdistan- Iraq) Mobile No. 00964-7701562687 \nMr. Dr. Chris Spindler in UF No. 0019043776904 http://rudaw.net/NewsDetails.aspx?pageid=110844", "id": "10153358006149684_10153359605874684", "user_likes": false}]}}
