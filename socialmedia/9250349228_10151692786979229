It's well worth taking 10 minutes to read - it's in full below and on our blog.\n\n>> http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/oceans/unlike-climate-change-fishing-magnificent-uncertainty-20140306\n\nThe weather forecast determines my life these days. This wind has been consistent in its strength since before Christmas, I got several big landings of line-caught squid then, and since then, a couple of days trying to catch mackerel, but that\u2019s it.\n\nI\u2018ve basically had no income since before Christmas. I have had a skin full of this. This is me at my lowest ebb. I have tried so hard, I suppose I am only coping by selling things and in that sense I am lucky - I know others that have got nothing to sell \u2013 but those sales have dried-up. I haven\u2019t anything else to realistically sell.\n\nI don\u2019t want any tears from anyone but I got back my engagement ring from my fianc\u00e9e and I am going to sell it. I\u2019ve sold my angling rights on the beautiful River Fowey, I treasured it and it was a lifelong wish to fish in those waters. Now it\u2019s gone.\n\nI used to do some filming, and that too has ended, so my camera gear will, if all else fails, be sold. Then at the end of the day, not too far in the future I guess, I will sell the house, and then the boat. There are no jobs. I really don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know what world the prime minister is living in, but it\u2019s not down here in Cornwall, the recession is still in full swing.\n\nAn old Cornish fisherman repeatedly said: \u201cFishing is the magnificent uncertainty.\u201d He was right, but fishing communities 100 years ago were not based on razor-blade economics and driven by factors and rules that continually flow from city offices.\n\nThings have changed so much. Having fished for over 30 years, I never thought that our seas would end up in this state, being threatened by climate change. I was a diver for over 35 years and seawater temperature in February was nine degrees centigrade, or perhaps one degree higher \u2013 it was bloody cold and we never wore gloves, you couldn\u2019t do the job with gloves. But touching the sea today, it\u2019s at least 12 degrees.\n\nTen years ago, I sold my existing 16ft boat and invested in the best high-tech small fishing boat that I could afford \u2013 Amanda J \u2013 a one-man boat bought to specialize in high quality fish and shellfish. I also bought a high quality ice machine, plus all the added equipment in line fishing, all that costing well over \u00a345,000.\n\nIn previous years with Amanda J I did well, but now, at the start of 2014 the tables have turned and I can do nothing about it. Line fishing in these conditions of wild wind and heavy rain is a waste of time. It is the worst wind and rain that I can remember in over 60 years of life. I\u2019m sure I am no different to any other UK fisherman; we have never known weather like this. I have known winds of this force but not for this length of time.\n\nThis should be the busiest time of the year for me because mackerel was here in the bay, and line caught mackerel at a time of low landings is like gold dust, the prices can be very high, mackerel making more money than bass. But the truth \u2013 all the small scale artisanal fishers of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and everywhere else, are broke; we are worried about the future and whether we\u2019re going to survive.\n\nNo one can doubt now that there are changes in the weather. In my opinion, we are just standing on a tiny bit of rock in a huge universe. We exist on a thin layer of Earth surface, one we seem determined to destroy.\n\nSomething is wrong. Governments and scientists (if those governments will fund them sufficiently) should make their top priority a quest to find out what\u2019s going on. If we (they) are going to fix it, and we may have already gone too far, surely that is first on the list of any politician?\n\nBut politicians are ducking and diving \u2013 gaining votes seems to be more attractive to them than helping to find a solution to climate change. But, I guess they are just like everyone else \u2013 trying to keep their jobs \u2013 but we need common sense; politicians must stop playing around with politics, because we are running out of time.\n\nSeriously, very seriously, if we do not do something, that \u2018something\u2019 will do it for us, and we have just had a taste of what messing about with nature produces \u2013 wild fluctuations \u2013 no one can realistically cope with that.", "total": {"new": 14.224137931, "months": {"1": 47, "3": 137, "2": 48}, "reeng": {"10": 152, "1": 33, "3": 11, "2": 1, "5": 8, "4": 5, "7": 11, "6": 2, "9": 6, "8": 3}, "month": 20.2586206897}, "type": "status", "id": "9250349228_10151692786979229", "comments": {"months": {"1": 12, "3": 6, "2": 7}, "reeng": {"1": 6, "10": 10, "3": 4, "5": 4, "4": 1}, "month": 48.0, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "Mjg=", "before": "Mjg="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/9250349228_10151692786979229/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=Mjg%3D"}, "new": 24.0, "summary": {"total_count": 28, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "10155568556645521", "name": "Adam Dukes"}, "like_count": 15, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-03-09T11:49:59+0000", "message": "I like that, rather than taking the real message of climate change affecting real people, people are using this as a justification to malign this man for his choice of profession. \"He should just stop being a fisherman and find a new job\", and when he can't then i guess we can just blame him for being poor.
