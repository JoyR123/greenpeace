They said they're \"vehemently against\" the destructive fishing shown in our undercover footage. But they're STILL not stating they'll ban Fish Aggregation Devices by 2016 like they promised to.\n\nWe need an answer, not confusing spin.\n \nKeep up the pressure - add your name >> http://bit.ly/1tqY1nS\n\nThen see our response to John West\u2019s claims >> http://bit.ly/1t8yRLa", "datetime": [2014, 10, 24, 16], "pid": 9250349228, "comments": {"months": {"10": 5, "1": 16, "3": 5, "2": 4, "5": 2, "4": 4, "7": 4, "6": 2, "9": 2, "8": 4}, "reeng": {"10": 38, "1": 5, "5": 1, "7": 2, "9": 1, "8": 1}, "month": 33.3333333333, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "NDk=", "before": "NDk="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/10152099725434229/comments?access_token=192154930871376%7CUId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&pretty=0&summary=1&limit=1&after=NDk%3D"}, "new": 10.4166666667, "summary": {"total_count": 49, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "10155523177720176", "name": "George Holloway"}, "like_count": 22, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-10-24T17:24:20+0000", "message": "After watching the documentary film cowspiracy I was extremely worried at the lack of environmental organisations' willingness to stand up to the cattle industry, which is globally one of the biggest emissions of greenhouse gases. I fully understand that people do not like being told what to eat, but they should at least be made aware of it.\n\nMany people consume dairy and are unaware that the fact milk is cheaper than water leads to all sorts of health and environmental problems in which the taxpayer is forced to foot the bill. All this in the name of an incredibly environmentally destructive industry. Yet it is being heavily subsidised with our taxes.\n\nI'm no vegan, and I'm not expecting you to try and make people give up animal products altogether, but if you could draw attention to the massively underestimated role of animal agriculture to climate change, and the contribution of human overpopulation to virtually every environmental problem, then people might take you more seriously. Yes you'll put off people who can't face the truth, but you can't avoid these issues.\n\nI think you do a great job with this as far as fishing is concerned, so now I think you need to do it with meat. Make a big thing of alternatives to meat and dairy. Lobby governments to demand that origins are always stated for every ingredient. And remind people of the benefits of having fewer, or less children. So many people are willing to change their lifestyles only if there are alternatives that don't make them feel like they're missing out.", "id": "10152099725434229_10152099943144229", "user_likes": false}]}, "height": 476, "created_time": "2014-10-24T16:00:01+0000", "width": 720, "edge": "objects", "likes": {"months": {"10": 172, "1": 154, "3": 73, "2": 100, "5": 67, "4": 71, "7": 77, "6": 60, "9": 54, "8": 74}, "reeng": {"10": 769, "1": 36, "3": 19, "2": 8, "5": 18, "4": 6, "7": 10, "6": 7, "9": 15, "8": 14}, "month": 17.0731707317, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "NDM1Mjk0OTQ2NjM3ODA1", "before": "NDM1Mjk0OTQ2NjM3ODA1"}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/10152099725434229/likes?access_token=192154930871376%7CUId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&pretty=0&summary=1&limit=1&after=NDM1Mjk0OTQ2NjM3ODA1"}, "new": 3.9911308204, "summary": {"total_count": 929}, "data": [{"id": "435294946637805", "name": "Mike Mihailov"}]}, "urls": [{"components": {"fragment": "", "netloc": "secure.greenpeace.org.uk", "params": "", "query": {"utm_campaign": "20141024ocfb04", "subsource": "20141024ocfb04", "utm_source": "gpeace", "js": "false", "source": "fb", "utm_medium": "fb"}, "path": ["page", "speakout", "dirty-tuna"], "scheme": "https"}, "url": "http://bit.ly/1tqY1nS", "driver": null, "ea": {"ea.campaign.id": null, "ea.client.id": null}, "redir": {"service": "bit.ly", "url": "https://secure.greenpeace.org.uk/page/speakout/dirty-tuna?js=false&source=fb&subsource=20141024ocfb04&utm_source=gpeace&utm_medium=fb&utm_campaign=20141024ocfb04", "surl": "1tqY1nS", "key": "74dbd48cc75fe5e09e674277840cdc59", "aurora": false, "history": ["http://bit.ly/1tqY1nS"]}, "landing": "https://secure.greenpeace.org.uk/page/speakout/dirty-tuna?js=false&source=fb&subsource=20141024ocfb04&utm_source=gpeace&utm_medium=fb&utm_campaign=20141024ocfb04", "key": "74dbd48cc75fe5e09e674277840cdc59", "petition": null}, {"components": {"fragment": "", "netloc": "greenpeace.org.uk", "params": "", "query": {"source": "fb", "utm_medium": "fb", "subsource": "20141024ocfb05", "utm_source": "gpeace", "utm_campaign": "20141024ocfb05"}, "path": ["blog", "oceans", "john-west-really-%E2%80%9Cvehemently-against%E2%80%9D-dirty-tuna-fishing-20141024"], "scheme": "http"}, "url": "http://bit.ly/1t8yRLa", "driver": null, "ea": {"ea.campaign.id": null, "ea.client.id": null}, "redir": {"service": "bit.ly", "url": "http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/oceans/john-west-really-%E2%80%9Cvehemently-against%E2%80%9D-dirty-tuna-fishing-20141024?source=fb&subsource=20141024ocfb05&utm_source=gpeace&utm_medium=fb&utm_campaign=20141024ocfb05", "surl": "1t8yRLa", "key": "fc9471e30558b1212c4f0745ecee5a43", "aurora": false, "history": ["http://bit.ly/1t8yRLa"]}, "landing": "http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/oceans/john-west-really-%E2%80%9Cvehemently-against%E2%80%9D-dirty-tuna-fishing-20141024?source=fb&subsource=20141024ocfb05&utm_source=gpeace&utm_medium=fb&utm_campaign=20141024ocfb05", "key": "fc9471e30558b1212c4f0745ecee5a43", "petition": null}], "images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/1488813_10152099725434229_34702850182381535_n.jpg?oh=f978b22a09f6516afb582c6ecbec65e4&oe=55C7FB8E", "height": 526, "width": 795}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p480x480/1488813_10152099725434229_34702850182381535_n.jpg?oh=c8cf255e080476d174e32541bfa02217&oe=55FE2AF6", "height": 480, "width": 725}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p320x320/1488813_10152099725434229_34702850182381535_n.jpg?oh=2f31c58dead64b855258de2249a6feaf&oe=55FADFAA", "height": 320, "width": 483}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p130x130/1488813_10152099725434229_34702850182381535_n.jpg?oh=4528dd0fc556d81ae75581ac16bb0e71&oe=55C5F33A", "height": 130, "width": 196}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/p75x225/1488813_10152099725434229_34702850182381535_n.jpg?oh=8590336241e31ba5a0f5de2d3549f9ae&oe=55FC1241", "height": 225, "width": 340}], "total": {"new": 4.4228694714, "months": {"10": 175, "1": 163, "3": 74, "2": 104, "5": 69, "4": 72, "7": 79, "6": 61, "9": 55, "8": 75}, "reeng": {"10": 784, "1": 41, "3": 19, "2": 8, "5": 19, "4": 6, "7": 12, "6": 7, "9": 16, "8": 15}, "month": 17.5836030205}, "id": "10152099725434229"}
