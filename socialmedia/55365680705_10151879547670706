The global wind energy sector employs around one million people. Within a short time span another one million will have been added.\n\nFor the first time the world community has access to the stories behind the challenges and successes that made the ongoing energy transition possible. Some of the chapters of the wind energy books are written by my friends in their position as pioneers and scientists.", "id": "10151879547660706_11614379", "user_likes": false}]}}
