Trees are being cut down and the land is converted to pasture for cattle and for soy beans. The wood is being exported to Europe and other continents. \nThe last ancient forests are formed naturally over millions of years. Virtually intact, they contribute to the proper functioning of ecological processes and contain treasures of life\nBIODIVERSITY means the number, or abundance of different species living within a particular region.\nProtecting our rainforest from a scheduled destruction is a major challenge for humanity and it is a primary goal.\n\nConsequences: \nThe loss of biodiversity is a loss of stability, genetic materials, water, food, medicine materials, share of future treasures and possibilities such as landscape.  Also, it contributes to protect the ozone layer. \nHuge quantities of C02 go into the atmosphere. \nForests of Africa and Brazil are plundered to supply wood for European constructions.\nWhole countries are dying because of the massive export of wood, meat or soya. When we burn wood in the fire place, we deprive ourselves of useful raw materials for making furniture\u2019s or houses.\nThe Amazonian Indians end up in slums or commit suicide.  They are murdered or raped. \nDesertification spreads throughout Brazil, in the medium term as in the case of Africa. \nBurning wood is not at all an ecological cycle ash has a little value for feeding soils. There are C02 emissions and a loss of humification process. \nWithout dense forests on the territory, ground water is depleted, soils are dying.\nThe wood for the fireplaces comes from French forest. Meanwhile french soil and aquifers are depleted.\nWe lose biodiversity.\n\nSo we should learn from the mistakes of the past\n\nHow can we stop this progressive destruction of the rainforest?\n\nIt is already time for us to start seriously replanting of trees.\nWe can burn buchettes once or twice a year for the holidays but that\u2019s all. \n-There\u2019s no need to cut down the forest to find  new fertile grounds. We must rehabilitate degraded soils worldwide because of intensive agriculture. Cutting down the forest will only cause the soils to die and severe aridity. \n-We must drasticaly reduce the consumption of certain products such as wood for fireplace, meat and produce compost of organic household products. Positive energy houses, strong and recyclables products.\n-Wilderness must regain at least half of its old self again. We must address now the problem at hand because too many people are suffering because of it!\n-Compost with organic vaste, agro economy, and wind energy.\n-There are too many people on Earth.\n\n   David DESMONS", "id": "10152154398107543_10152156168322543", "user_likes": false}]}}
