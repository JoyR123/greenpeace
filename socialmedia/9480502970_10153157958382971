Seize the opportunity to join the movement to divest from fossil fuels, and stop profiting from climate change. \n\nFUNCH will be there promoting divestment with sustainable Blender Bikes - cycle your way to a delicious smoothie that won't cost you or the planet a cent.\n\nWith our University recently announcing that it will not invest further into coal and other combustable fuels until a review of its investment practices has been finalised, there has never been a better time to engage with the global debate on whether individuals and institutions committed to sustainability should cease investment in fossil fuels. \n\nThe University of Sydney can be a part of the solution to climate change, and so can you."}
