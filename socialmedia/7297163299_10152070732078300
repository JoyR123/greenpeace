I am Robert. I live in Korea, Jeju. You will know my nation because our land used 234% of energy in 2007 (sorry).\nI think the Greenpeace protesters are kind of like soldiers (it\u2019s not teasing). You risk your life for nature. I was so shocked!\nI heard that you, Greenpeace, is protesting to stop nuclear power station. I agree! I don\u2019t want to hear nuclear power station accident like the Chernobyl accident in 1986. Oh! And I have a lot of suggestion for Greenpeace group.\nFirst, how about making a Greenpeace character? Do you know Popeye? The sailor man who become strong when he eat spinach? Because of Popeye, many spinach were selled by Popeye\u2019s fans! I don\u2019t have much of idea of a name, but how about make a character like this? : in his (or her) head has plant and he have a cape, and his shirt has a big G for \u2018Green\u2019 and how about the story\u2026 the hero has a secret identity as normal, he work at Greenpeace. When CO2, N2O etc. appears, and fight them. But the hero can\u2019t fight if the energy is wasting, use many papers, cut trees.\nSecond, how about making the Greenpeace forest called \u201cGreenpeace land\u201d? At Greenpeace land, how about planting contest, find  the something that makes global warming (sodas can make CO2, hair spray hair container make Global Warming!) the children will understand nature. The future is the children abnd the future is the nature, so that\u2019s why I made this suggestion.\nWell, that\u2019s the end of my suggestion. Oh please write me an answer, and\u2026 I will always help the nature, and our planet, Earth! Goodbye! And mother nature bless you (tee hee\u2026)\nYear 2014,\n1/20\nMonday\nFrom, Robert.", "id": "10152070722878300_11231840", "user_likes": false}]}}
