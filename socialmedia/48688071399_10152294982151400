I am a researcher of natural processes and the head of a small group of developers environmental programs. Our programs are able to eliminate the warming in the global and regional level. And if you have the desire and financial capacity - about 45 - 50 million dollars - I come to the Philippines and we are together for 7 years will eliminate: \nThe temperature of the land of the Philippines and its seas. \nRestore the deepness and purity of all the rivers, streams and lakes due to the production of crystal clear, micronutrient-rich fresh water. In particular, in the river Pasig in three years will be a lot of fish. But five years later the river will be completely clean. \nClean Water will help to grow environmentally friendly products for tourists. Make travel industry elite - the best in the world - and earn decent money. Quickly compensate for the cost of restoring the ecology of the Philippines, and receive from the tourist industry profits. Successful tourism business will bring more investment. And who once rested on the Philippines, will arrive in the next year and will bring with them their relatives and acquaintances. \nOverall, I will say this: For 7 years I can help make the economy of the Philippines as a successful and prosperous Singapore. Therefore, please: Send my offer to the Government and Parliament of the Philippines - I guarantee success. \nInform: Program Management and Finance will be given to Filipino professionals. For me to remain a technical program management. \nBetter and cheaper to do this work throughout Australia and South Pacific region. Today, the region has experienced in Hurricane 4.5 per year. Every year, hurricanes will become less and less. \nThan it is beneficial to me personally? Success in the Philippines will be seen in three years. This will draw attention to the programs of other states, that is, a lot of work to begin to address the warming. \nSincerely, developer of environmental programs, Victor Rodin. \nMy location: Rodin Victor Kuzmich.
