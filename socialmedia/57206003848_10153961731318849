Along the way, director-producer Gabriela Cowperthwaite compiles shocking footage and emotional interviews to explore the creature\u2019s extraordinary nature, the species\u2019 cruel treatment in captivity, the lives and losses of the trainers and the pressures brought to bear by the multi-billion dollar sea-park industry.\n\nThis emotionally wrenching, tautly structured story challenges us to consider our relationship to nature and reveals how little we humans have learned from these highly intelligent and enormously sentient fellow mammals.\"\n\nHere is the link to the trailer: @[NjQyMTgzOTU5MjA4MTA3Omh0dHBzXGEvL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PXBxdkFNMHRIVEFBOjo=:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqvAM0tHTAA]\n\nAnd the website if you would like more information: @[NjQyMTgzOTU5MjA4MTA3Omh0dHBcYS8vYmxhY2tmaXNobW92aWUuY29tLzo6:http://blackfishmovie.com/]\n\nPlease note that the views in the film do not express the views and opinions of Greenpeace.
