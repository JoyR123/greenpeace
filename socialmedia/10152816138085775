Norwegian oil giant Statoil is about to begin seismic testing off the coast of Northland, Texan Anadarko just drilled two failed deep water wells and international giant Schlumberger has applied for a prospecting permit to survey 440,000 square kilometres of seabed - an area the size of New Zealand - in the Great South Basin. Drilling there could endanger areas such as the Auckland Islands which as you can see in this video are too precious to risk. \n\nShell, one of the companies that wants to drill in the Great South Basin, has just been caught drilling illegally near Taranaki citing only ignorance of the law as as defence. \n\nThe troubling thing about Shell\u2019s cavalier attitude to playing fast and loose with our laws is that this is the same company that wants to drill both in the dangerous, icy extremes of the Arctic and deep in our waters off the coast of Otago. Such a relaxed, willfully ignorant attitude to regulations in such difficult, hazardous environments is how accidents happen.\n\nTake action now and demand that the Government and the EPA prosecute Shell for this breach: http://grnpc.org/prosecute-shell"}
