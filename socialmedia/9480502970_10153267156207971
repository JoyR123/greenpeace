The AGM offers an opportunity to show opposition to the project and the corrupt approval processes which have plagued it, and which has already driven hundreds of Australians to stand up and take action.\n\nThis year, for the first time ever, the Bureau of Meteorology introduced two new colours to their weather mapping system in preparation for extreme weather events - two shades of purple. Whitehaven's dirty practices fuel climate change and extreme weather events that will fill Australia and the world with more and more purple. That's why, on Tuesday, we will be taking to the streets in a sea of purple, and putting climate change on the agenda. \n\nCome and defend farms, forest, community, culture and climate from corporate coalruption.\n\nPlease confirm your attendance by hitting 'attend' on this event, and don't forget to wear something purple!!\n\nIf you can't make it to this rally or the ones in Melbourne and Brisbane, definitely invite your friends to come along!\n\nBrisbane: https://www.facebook.com/events/1484585131804722/?ref_newsfeed_story_type=regular\n\nMelbourne: TBA\n\nRemember if you aren't in one of these cities we're all about spontaneous pandemonium - so tweet your solidarity actions under #LeardBlockade and get in contact at frontlineactiononcoal [at] gmail .com and we'll peacefully fry these guys."}
