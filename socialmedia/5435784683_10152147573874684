The Cushing fine was for failing to properly inspect in-service breakout tanks.[9]\n\nMore Spill\n\nSee Library\nfor printable version of this section.\nruptured Enbridge tar sands pipeline in Kalamazoo watershed\nKalamazoo Rupture, July 2010 In 2012 \nIn 2012 Business Insider named Enbridge one of the sixteen US pipeline operators with the most reported significant incidents per pipeline mile. [18]\n\nThe following are only some of the oil spills from Enbridge in Canada and the United States.\nJanuary 2001: Enbridge\u2019s Energy Transportation North Pipeline leaked 1,003,800 gallons of crude oil into a slough near Hardisty, Alberta.[11]\nJuly 2002: A 34-inch diameter steel pipeline ruptured in a marsh west of Cohasset, Minnesota. To prevent 252,000 gallons of crude oil from reaching the Mississippi River, the company set the oil on fire. The plume of smoke extended one mile high. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board blamed the rupture on \u201cinadequate loading of the pipe for transportation.\u201d[11]\nJanuary 2003: A pipeline failure resulted in a spill of 189,000 gallons of oil at Enbridge\u2019s oil terminal near Superior, Wis. Approximately 2100 gallons flowed into the Nemadji River, a tributary of Lake Superior.[11]\nApril/May 2004: U.S. pipeline regulators fined Enbridge for failing to properly inspect oil and gas pipelines in Michigan, Indiana and Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin.[11]\nMarch 2006: Enbridge announced its first tar sand oil shipment to Cushing OK.[14]\nJanuary 2007: A pipeline break near Stanley, N.D., spilled 9,030 gallons of oil. Regulators fined Enbridge for exceeding pressure standards for the pipeline.[11]\nFebruary 2007: An estimated 176,000 gallons spilled in two separate incidents in Clark and Rusk County, Wisconsin. One pipeline cracked open and couldn\u2019t be shut off until an operator in Canada shut down the line. In the second incident work crews broke the same line, filling a hole 20 feet deep with oil and contaminating local groundwater. The company was fined $100,000 for not following safety standards.[11]\nNovember 2007: A 34-inch pipeline carrying bitumen to U.S. Midwest markets exploded, killing two workers near Clearbrook, Minn. The pipe had leaked two weeks prior to the explosion and was being repaired. The fireball, which leapt 100 feet into the air, temporarily jacked up the price of oil by four dollars and closed four other pipelines delivering 63 million gallons of crude a day.[11]\nMay 2008: Alberta\u2019s energy regulator delivered a \u201chigh risk enforcement action\u201d against Enbridge for using \u201cvalves, flanges and fittings\u201d on its Midstream pipeline that were not suitable for maximum operating pressure. No fines were levied.[11]\nJanuary 2009: A valve blew on a pipe at the Enbridge Cheecham Terminal tank farm, spilling 168,000 gallons of oil near Anzac, Alberta. The leak wasn\u2019t detected for three hours and Alberta regulators issued no statements, because no member of the public was affected.[11]\nJanuary 2010: A pipeline leaked 126,000 gallons near Neche, N.D. The feds had warned Enbridge twice that older pipelines were susceptible to failure. The line is part of the 1,900-mile-long Lakehead System that delivers crude from western Canada to Cushing, Oklahoma and Chicago.[11]\nJuly 2010: Enbridge shut its 12 million gallons per day Line 6B, which runs from Griffiths, Indiana, to Sarnia, Ontario, on July 26 after a rupture near Marshall, Michigan, spilled about 840,000 gallons of Cold Lake crude oil into the Kalamazoo River system.[12]\nSeptember 2010: Enbridge closed Line 6A for eight days after it leaked 256,200 gallonsof crude near Romeoville, Illinois.[12]\nMay 2011: Enbridge estimates between 29,400 and 63,000 gallons of oil spilled from the 1.6 million gallons per day Norman Wells pipeline south of Wrigley, Northwest Territories.[12]\nJune 2012: Enbridge shut 14.5 million gallon per day Athabasca pipeline after 58,800 gallons of oil were spilled near Elk Point in northeast Alberta. The line was quickly restarted after the company was able to bypass the Elk Point pump station.[12]\nJuly 2012: Pipeline segment 14 in the Lakehead system ruptures near Grand Marsh WI., spilling 50,400 gallons of crude oil.[13]\nAugust 2012: PHMSA demands a detailed plan  and timeline, and an independent expert to assess and correct hazardous conditions in the entire 1900-mile Lakehead system by Enbridge before line 14 can be reopened.[13]\nNovember 2012: Enbridge shut down pipeline segment 14 again after 37,800 gallons of crude oil leaked at the Mokena tank farm near Chicago.[15]", "id": "10152147573874684_29492456", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2014, 1, 8, 1], "full_picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQAZlEGtwjuA1CpW&url=http%3A%2F%2Fupw-prod-images.global.ssl.fastly.net%2Fnugget%2F52542c8840ee093e3f000591%2Fbutter4.jpg", "caption": "upworthy.com", "edge": "posts", "link": "http://www.upworthy.com/you-should-watch-this-strange-man-rub-a-stick-of-butter-on-a-tree-for-a-really-good-reason?c=gp1", "shares": {"count": 100}, "urls": [], "created_time": "2014-01-08T01:00:00+0000", "message": "Enbridge, a Canadian energy company with a long, awful track record when it comes to caring about people and the places they live, is trying to build another pipeline.
