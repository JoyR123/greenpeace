Their mission: to negotiate with Native American loggers and change the way this forest is logged before it\u2019s too late for acoustic guitars.\n\nGreenpeace is thrilled to help welcome Musicwood to Washington, DC. Join Director Maxine Trump, Producer Josh Granger and Greenpeace Global Forests Campaign Leader Matt Daggett for a \u201cGreenpeace Night\u201d screening of the film and an Q+A.\n\nJoin us on Tuesday night for a screening of the documentary and a Q+A panel afterwards!"}
