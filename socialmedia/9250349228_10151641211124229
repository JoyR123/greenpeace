And what a time we\u2019ve had together.\n\nRemember the Nestle and Mattel meltdown when you guys took to their page to demand an end to deforestation? Or when VW asked \u201cwhat would you like us to do in 2012?\u201d and you replied in your thousands, asking them to stop blocking climate laws? And Waitrose's live Facebook Q&A with Delia Smith seemed a good opportunity to ask about the supermarket's partnership with Shell. Although they maybe didn't agree.\n\nFacebook themselves weren't immune either. Together, we broke a world record with 80,000 comments posted in 24 hours, asking Facebook to unfriend coal. And they did.\n\nOur Facebook community can do incredible things. Let's keep going. \n\nSHARE this post with your friends, ask them to join the page and take your activism to the next level here: http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/groups", "total": {"new": 16.4461247637, "months": {"1": 206, "2": 852}, "reeng": {"10": 440, "1": 174, "3": 142, "5": 121, "4": 10, "7": 78, "6": 10, "9": 73, "8": 10}, "month": 19.4706994329}, "type": "photo", "id": "9250349228_10151641211124229", "petition": null, "comments": {"months": {"1": 7, "2": 18}, "reeng": {"10": 11, "1": 5, "3": 3, "5": 3, "7": 2, "9": 1}, "month": 28.0, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "Mjc=", "before": "Mjc="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/9250349228_10151641211124229/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=Mjc%3D"}, "new": 20.0, "summary": {"total_count": 28, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "425789760914798", "name": "Alan Cook"}, "like_count": 5, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-02-04T16:29:31+0000", "message": "Thanks Pixie.
