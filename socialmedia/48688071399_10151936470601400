It drains our precious water supplies and spits back polluted skies, lakes, streams and rivers, both in its processing and production.\n\nCheck out this gallery \u261bhttp://bit.ly/waterenergy and we'll take you to a journey through the lives of people -- their homes and their lands -- who have been directly affected by coal power production.
