We have read the entire statement and are aware of it. The reason for this post is to emphasize on the ambiguity of that statement and seeming denial of climate reality when he said that climate change hasn't happened. There is a glaring contradiction when the Prime Minister of the country says people affect the environment but his government goes on to dilute critical environmental laws that may pave the way for a worse scenario. You can read more about this here: bit.ly/1xCkm5H. In addition, the Prime Minister is reportedly also not attending the Climate Change Summit this month, which adds to the stand he is taking. While his words may say something, his actions are contradictory and show otherwise.", "id": "10152347944782844_10152349671107844", "user_likes": false}]}, "height": 495, "created_time": "2014-09-09T15:00:00+0000", "width": 720, "edge": "objects", "likes": {"months": {"1": 237, "3": 87, "2": 142, "5": 87, "4": 86, "7": 58, "6": 45, "9": 132, "8": 67}, "reeng": {"10": 550, "1": 209, "3": 72, "2": 9, "5": 32, "4": 5, "7": 25, "6": 7, "9": 23, "8": 9}, "month": 25.1859723698, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxNTI5NDA0NjY5MDc4NzU=", "before": "MTAxNTI5NDA0NjY5MDc4NzU="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/10152347944782844/likes?access_token=192154930871376%7CUId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&pretty=0&summary=1&limit=1&after=MTAxNTI5NDA0NjY5MDc4NzU%3D"}, "new": 22.2104144527, "summary": {"total_count": 963}, "data": [{"id": "10152940466907875", "name": "Kenneth Ray"}]}, "urls": [], "images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/10696275_10152347944782844_8600754428634935813_n.jpg?oh=b18b443d487e90dc9bb868b09b72e63d&oe=55C45FF0", "height": 550, "width": 800}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p480x480/10696275_10152347944782844_8600754428634935813_n.jpg?oh=0db4e06230722449e5dd8bf9f62b84ca&oe=560ADFFA", "height": 480, "width": 698}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p320x320/10696275_10152347944782844_8600754428634935813_n.jpg?oh=c98877ad8f03e939cb9605d4432840bc&oe=56079AB8", "height": 320, "width": 465}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p180x540/10696275_10152347944782844_8600754428634935813_n.jpg?oh=f6b4f0de63ceb29cb3f7a58968611fa4&oe=55FF119D", "height": 540, "width": 785}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p130x130/10696275_10152347944782844_8600754428634935813_n.jpg?oh=01fdfc4c31ed74c954fd2e2bcaf1830f&oe=55C65AA8", "height": 130, "width": 189}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xta1/v/t1.0-9/p75x225/10696275_10152347944782844_8600754428634935813_n.jpg?oh=70f3df513855e0672950c3e2ebd1a9d5&oe=5606BAD6", "height": 225, "width": 327}], "total": {"new": 24.6889952153, "months": {"1": 288, "3": 98, "2": 154, "5": 90, "4": 93, "7": 60, "6": 53, "9": 138, "8": 71}, "reeng": {"10": 581, "1": 258, "3": 80, "2": 11, "5": 35, "4": 9, "7": 27, "6": 9, "9": 25, "8": 10}, "month": 27.5598086124}, "id": "10152347944782844"}
