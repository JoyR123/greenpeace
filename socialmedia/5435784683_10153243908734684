Your explanation was just what I needed to hear.  You really phrased it well.  I wish our weather people on TV were Just as articulate as you are.

There are people there who have lived in those areas way before the white man was even thought about.  Good thinking and good luck,  Noel Potts.", "id": "10153243908734684_10153247797294684", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2015, 4, 1, 13], "full_picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQCsyysfLoMLDDx6&url=http%3A%2F%2Fecowatch.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F03%2Ffb_meme_field.jpg", "caption": "ecowatch.com", "edge": "posts", "link": "http://ecowatch.com/2015/03/16/more-than-scientists-video-campaign/", "shares": {"count": 229}, "urls": [], "created_time": "2015-04-01T13:01:01+0000", "message": "Want to hear what scientists have to say about our climate?
