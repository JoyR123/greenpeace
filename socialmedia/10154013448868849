Heaven for fend that someone may take offense at a naughty word! With that in mind allow me to reiterate my point in less emotive language (thus avoiding censorship) Your response to my original post regarding child abuse and the responsibility of the church to own up to its vile involvement, I find rather staggering, you leap to the defense of this pope as if he is gods chosen representative (if he ACTUALLY was real don't you think God would be MORE interested in their CENTURIES long enslavement, abuse and in some case murder of societies most vulnerable, rather than a bloke in a dress telling us to drive less and switch our taps off after brushing our teeth). Should we not, in actuality be rightfully appalled and disgusted by any religion with this history of mass abuse of its powers, rather than glad handing a man that in his roll of head of the faith is responsible for centuries of denial of these horrific and evil deeds? I think green peace should stick to fact based scientific reasoning and leave the snake oil salesmen of a bygone age out of what is an important debate!", "id": "10154013448868849_10154015893363849", "user_likes": false}]}, "height": 429, "created_time": "2015-04-29T15:06:29+0000", "width": 652, "edge": "objects", "likes": {"months": {"11": 5, "10": 2, "12": 18, "1": 30, "3": 9, "2": 22, "5": 4, "4": 11, "7": 12, "6": 4, "9": 5, "8": 6}, "reeng": {"10": 99, "1": 6, "3": 3, "2": 2, "5": 3, "4": 3, "7": 4, "6": 3, "9": 2, "8": 3}, "month": 23.4375, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTU3MjQ1NzkyOTY4ODQyNA==", "before": "MTU3MjQ1NzkyOTY4ODQyNA=="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/10154013448868849/likes?access_token=883483195046454%7C9nfpAUxoDRMZ77lLiQ83CrnaV3s&pretty=0&summary=1&limit=1&after=MTU3MjQ1NzkyOTY4ODQyNA%3D%3D"}, "new": 4.6875, "summary": {"total_count": 130}, "data": [{"id": "1572457929688424", "name": "Diana Harris"}]}, "urls": [{"components": {"fragment": "", "netloc": "bit.ly", "params": "", "query": {}, "path": ["1EoL1DA"], "scheme": "http"}, "url": "http://bit.ly/1EoL1DA", "driver": null, "ea": {"ea.campaign.id": null, "ea.client.id": null}, "redir": {"service": "bit.ly", "url": "http://bit.ly/1EoL1DA", "surl": "1EoL1DA", "key": "5e18bb798effe0d57726ba9948b433da", "aurora": false, "history": []}, "landing": "http://bit.ly/1EoL1DA", "key": "5e18bb798effe0d57726ba9948b433da", "petition": null}], "images": [{"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtp1/v/t1.0-9/1463178_10154013448868849_7869146685708189651_n.jpg?oh=178bc44c300bf1f8dc8cf1e0ff31ef71&oe=5605CB4A", "height": 429, "width": 652}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtp1/v/t1.0-9/p320x320/1463178_10154013448868849_7869146685708189651_n.jpg?oh=9a5da7255ff220a7859554cbf8a99d00&oe=55FB7321", "height": 320, "width": 486}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtp1/v/t1.0-9/p130x130/1463178_10154013448868849_7869146685708189651_n.jpg?oh=18b4b6ffe23b5df94c3d0c620a435eb4&oe=55FDD4C6", "height": 130, "width": 197}, {"source": "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtp1/v/t1.0-9/p75x225/1463178_10154013448868849_7869146685708189651_n.jpg?oh=b03f18025b762690a75fec468a2d7b87&oe=55BEF803", "height": 225, "width": 341}], "total": {"new": 4.5801526718, "months": {"11": 5, "10": 2, "12": 18, "1": 31, "3": 9, "2": 24, "5": 4, "4": 11, "7": 12, "6": 4, "9": 5, "8": 6}, "reeng": {"10": 101, "1": 6, "3": 4, "2": 2, "5": 3, "4": 3, "7": 4, "6": 3, "9": 2, "8": 3}, "month": 23.6641221374}, "id": "10154013448868849"}
