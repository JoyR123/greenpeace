I have just returned from Nepal after 10 days providing disaster aid and will be returning in the next couple of weeks (I have not left and forgotten about the people - we have a team of nepalise VOLENTEERS who are distributing the aid to the most needed places). \n\nNot once did I see any presence from the \"big 13 charities\" which DEC raise money for. Actually that's a lie, I saw some very expensive trucks branded in Oxfam pointlessly driving around. Its a massive scam people. Your money is wasted going to any large charities. I would have thought 38degrees would be aware of this too!! \n\nIf you want to donate money to help Nepal please donate to Lincs2Nepal, we are 100% voluntary, every penny raised goes to the people who need it the most.
