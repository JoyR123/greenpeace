The GBR hosts to range of protected species including endangered marine turtles, dugongs and molluscs.  In addition to this, the lively tourism industry is guaranteed to suffer detrimental effects, with UNESCO recently saying that if the Great Barrier Reef was to be placed on the endangered list tourism would greatly suffer not only in Queensland but throughout Australia.\n\nThe Reef is simply too precious for us to lose. \n\n Meanwhile, our government is busy giving tax breaks to coal barons, while getting ready to cut essential services, health, welfare and education. They've also made themselves busy in approving horrendous destruction in the Leard State Forest, helping out MP Clive Palmer by approving the Abbot Point port expansion for his new China First coal mine, and plan to strip Tasmanian wilderness of heritage protection.\n\n This is not a Government which cares about our precious environment and we cannot allow our planet be ruined this way.\n\n So join us this Saturday at 12pm at the State Library of Victoria for a rally and march to Federation Square, demonstrating against these attacks on our environment and the Great Barrier Reef. \n\nWe also ask that, if possible, you come dressed up as if it is your last day ever to the beach.  That is, come in board shorts, Hawaiian shirts, thongs, sunscreen, hats, even floaties.  Its going to be a hot day, but dont worry, @[278612582224112:274:Melbourne Street Medics]] will be in attendance providing First Aid to anyone needing it!\n\nEvent organised by members of The Australian Student Environment Network\n\n***EVENT ENDORSEMENTS***\n350.org\nAustralian Marine Conservation Society\nAustralian Student Environment Network (ASEN)\nAustralian Young Greens\nFriends of the Earth\nGreenpeace \nKeep Left Poetry\nMelbourne Street Medics\nMonash Student Association (MSA)\nNational Tertiary Education Union\nNational Union of Students\nPirate Party\nSave the Planet Party\nSocialist Alliance\nSocialist Alternative \nSolidarity\nVictorian Greens \nSpeakers TBA.  \n\nIf you or your organisation wished to endorse this event please post below on the page, or if you have any queries or wish to get involved in organising please contact Patrick Dollard on 0447719945\n\n***EVENTS IN OTHER STATES***\nTell Tony No - Don't Dump on our Reef!!!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/577411032344703/?ref=2&ref_dashboard_filter=upcoming\n\nDefend our environment!
