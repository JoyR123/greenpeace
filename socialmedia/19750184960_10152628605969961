This pipeline will only dangerously increase Canada's contribution to climate change as well as risk spills in communities, lakes and rivers across the country.\n\nThough despite knowing that, we are not disheartened, our resolve just grows as we see pipeline opposition growing daily across the country. We're going to fight this. The Energy East pipeline won't be built.
