If deep sea drilling goes wrong, it could be many times worse. Statoil will begin seismic testing off the coast of Northland this summer.\n\nTake action now to Stop Deep Sea Drilling \n>>>>http://bit.ly/1s5iMAA\n\n\n'Like a countless assembly of small ghostly shadows urging us to do better' the oil prints featured in this exhibition were made with imprints of the body of a little blue penguin dipped in the oil that killed it. Oil that was spilled by the 2011 Rena shipwreck in the bay of Plenty.\n\nIt and the other bird featured in the Oil on Canvas' exhibition are just two of an estimated 20,000 birds killed after the shipwrecked Rena spilled 350 tonnes of oil into the Bay of Plenty. It is hoped that the work can serve as a memorial to the creatures that lost their lives and as a stark warning against the far greater risk posed by deep sea oil drilling in NZ waters.\n\nMore info here:\nhttp://www.greenpeace.org.nz/oiloncanvas/", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"11": 47, "10": 14, "1": 39, "3": 19, "2": 27, "5": 14, "4": 23, "7": 12, "6": 21, "9": 16, "8": 18}, "reeng": {"10": 170, "3": 5, "2": 26, "5": 2, "4": 13, "7": 7, "6": 9, "9": 8, "8": 10}, "month": 15.6}, "id": "11870725774_10152837751655775", "cloud": null, "comments": {"months": {"11": 4, "10": 6, "1": 2, "3": 2, "2": 3, "5": 1, "7": 1, "6": 1, "8": 1}, "reeng": {"9": 2, "8": 1, "2": 2, "10": 16}, "month": 9.5238095238, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MjM=", "before": "MjM="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/11870725774_10152837751655775/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=192154930871376|UId84Xk892l1KRwFkGLe8ztkcOs&after=MjM%3D"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 23, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "10206277403751822", "name": "Morgan Osvald Smith"}, "like_count": 5, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-11-06T03:22:15+0000", "message": "not sure what your point is here, are you trying to ban shipping or deep sea oil? \nBecause if you ban deep sea oil it means more oil will be carried by ships, and far more oil spills have occurred from shipping and transportation of oil rather than off shore production sites.
