This tuna is fished with destructive methods that gather together all kinds of species before scooping them out of the water, where unwanted 'bycatch' like endangered sharks, turtles and rays are thrown away, dead or dying.\n\nAll this pressure is making a difference. Tesco have said that they will insist O&P makes a commitment to a more sustainable fishing policy.
