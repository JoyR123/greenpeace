Not good. But the lease is for a much, smaller piece of land, and for a far shorter period of time. \n\nOriginally Herakles was hoping for 73,000 hectares of rainforest (730 square kilometers). But the lease they've been given is now less than 20,000 hectares (200km2). That\u2019s almost a quarter of the size -- and valid for just 36 months.\n\nIt means that together -- with local communities, NGOs, and people like you -- we\u2019ve saved at least 53,000 hectares of Cameroon rainforest and pristine primate habitat.\n\n**But despite this, social conflicts and legal problems remain. Herakles Farms plantation is the wrong project in the wrong place, and it will set a very bad precedent if it isn\u2019t stopped.**\n\nSo we\u2019re not stopping.\n\nIn response to the ongoing harassment of local organisations who are standing up to Herakles, Greenpeace Africa has, along with many other local and international NGOs, called on UN independent reporters to investigate the situation.\n\nWe\u2019re also still sending thousands of emails a month to the directors of Herakles Farms, calling on them to abandon their plans. When last did you email them?\n\nTake a stand today >> http://act.gp/11XdKPX", "total": {"new": 0.0, "months": {"1": 270, "2": 370}, "reeng": {"10": 165, "3": 6, "2": 224, "5": 9, "4": 107, "7": 6, "6": 60, "9": 8, "8": 55}, "month": 42.1875}, "type": "photo", "id": "57206003848_10152655343018849", "petition": {"cc": "ZA", "basket": "forests", "issue": "herakles farms"}, "comments": {"months": {"1": 7, "2": 5}, "reeng": {"10": 2, "2": 7, "4": 1, "7": 1, "6": 1}, "month": 58.3333333333, "paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTc=", "before": "MTc="}, "next": "https://graph.facebook.com/v2.3/57206003848_10152655343018849/comments?limit=1&summary=1&access_token=883483195046454|9nfpAUxoDRMZ77lLiQ83CrnaV3s&after=MTc%3D"}, "new": 0.0, "summary": {"total_count": 17, "order": "ranked"}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "10155530043240313", "name": "Mike Baillie"}, "like_count": 10, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2014-02-05T09:15:08+0000", "message": "This is an important start -- but we need the whole thing to be cancelled!
