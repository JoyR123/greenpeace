It's not that I'm looking past that. Because of industry standards I'm pretty well locked into having to own Apple Products and find them to be a pleasure to use - for a while. The problem with Apple Products is their life span. While spending 3-4 times the amount I would spend on another brand I would hope the life span would be longer. It's pretty much throw away equipment after 6 or so years. I spent almost $6k on my old system. Four years later I took my system to an Apple Store and found out that it was considered to be \"vintage\" and therefore not applicable to be worked on in the store. I can no longer upgrade my system software. Basically, this huge desktop is set for recycling and the rest to a landfill. So forgive me for not \"celebrating\" Apple as a responsible world citizen. Until they start making products that have a longer life span than a few years I will not celebrate Apple for anything but being a land fill space hog.", "id": "10152667253904684_10152667737374684", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2014, 8, 15, 22], "full_picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQB3bLBmjncz-FJi&url=http%3A%2F%2Fgreenpeaceblogs.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2014%2F08%2Fiphone.jpg", "caption": "greenpeaceblogs.org", "edge": "posts", "link": "http://greenpeaceblogs.org/2014/08/15/apple-takes-first-steps-detox-manufacturing-supply-chain/?utm_source=USFB&utm_medium=link+preview&utm_campaign=apple", "shares": {"count": 193}, "urls": [], "created_time": "2014-08-15T22:00:00+0000", "message": "Yes!
