How are you going to celebrate it? By liking a post, sharing a post, playing a quiz on Google homepage? C'mon people. Grow up and take it on a serious note. It is our only HOME! Earth is getting destroyed everyday. We have lost our green cover by a large margin, we have lost our right to get safe, clean water and we have to purchase it to survive, we have 13 cities from India out of top 20 most polluted city of the world, Delhi being on top, our farmers are committing suicides due to unbalanced rain etc. We have no reason to celebrate it but to repent it. squint emoticon\nWe need to act really fast together so that we can actually celebrate it in future. Now real question is how to do it? Task sounds really tough but it is not.  \nWe at Greenpeace India are giving a platform to every individual to come forward and save this world from money-hungry bureaucrats. Here in this page you will find TRUTH of the World's climate change and stories of fight between Democracy and Bureaucracy. You have witnessed stories like Mahan, first solar village of India in Dharnai, Bihar.. \nThere are more wonderful stories we are going to create. But our government is forcing us to close down in India so that they can be free to make profit out of our environment. \nIgnoring this fight is gonna harm you only. Because if you can't stand for your own AIR, FOOD, FOREST, WATER then who will? Support this fight. #ISupportGPIndia", "id": "10152822665902844_10152823371332844", "user_likes": false}]}}
