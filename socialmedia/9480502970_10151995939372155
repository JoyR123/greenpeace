Please do NOT wear campaign or political party shirts (this includes things like 100% renewables, The Greens, LTG or AYCC shirts). Dress corporate if you are comfortable with that, otherwise smart casual.\n\nRight now, Whitehaven Coal and their contractors are ripping up the Leard State Forest, a significant ecological hotspot, home to 34 threatened and critically endangered species like the Koala. Their proposed mine would have the same annual greenhouse gas emissions as the entire New Zealand energy sector and would significantly impact the local community.\n\nWhile the local community including the Gomeroi people have tried every legal avenue possible to stop this mine from going ahead, their calls have fallen on deaf ears. All that now stands in the way of the mine is the community. A blockade camp has been in position for over 500 days, and more activists are needed up there to help, especially now that the bulldozers have moved in! In the mean time, we want to tell people in Brisbane what Whitehaven is doing, by holding this vigil for the Leard State Forest.\n\n\nSo come along to the Whitehaven Coal office in Brisbane and let them know they have a fight on their hands. There will be activists also visiting the Whitehaven office in Sydney and Newcastle to show their support, so lets get a crowd along! \n\nBring all the mates you can muster and lets stop this Coal mine from going ahead. \n\nMeet at 12pm on the 20th outside their office at 345 Queen St Brisbane"}
