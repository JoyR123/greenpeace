However, toxic chemicals can accumulate in the environment and may also pose potential health impacts to humans. This is why Greenpeace encourages the use of secondhand clothing. It not only reduces waste but also contributes less to the increasing accumulation of toxic chemicals in the environment.\n\nGreenpeace and non-profit children clothes swapping platform Seesaw Seesaw are co-organizing a secondhand kids clothes swap party. Parents can bring their children\u2019s clothes for swapping. There will also be a seminar conducted by Greenpeace to share smart tips on how to avoid toxic fashion.\n\nHead here for more details: http://www.greenpeace.org/eastasia/news/blog/seesaw-seesaw-x-greenpeace-secondhand-kids-cl/blog/48168/"}
