Having a child who probably goes on to have to children themselves, increases your Carbon footprint exponentially. After that I think it's food, so become vegan/vegetarian or at the very least try to ensure that your food is organic and sustainably sourced and not packed in a one-use plastic container. Beyond that, ride a bike/walk instead of driving a car, try to mend and make do rather than buying new and switch your lights and your heating off where you can. Nobody is perfect, but it shouldnt stop someone from trying. I've been a veggie for as long as I can remember and I'm trying to be vegan, though I admit, it isn't easy. I try to ride my bike or walk whenever I can and if I can't, I use public transport. However, there is a lot of conflicting information and most people are unlikely to do everything they could do, but I think if you can make one real change and stick to it, then it's a step in the right direction. Ultimately, it's very hard to change the mind set of adults, so education with kids is the way for real change on a global scale to happen. Again though, it's not easy. I think Greenpeace and many other environmentally-focused organisations do some fantastic work, but change has to be at a national level if it is ever going to have the kind of impact it needs to. I have been pleased recently with the 'save the Arctic' campaigns, various marine charities helping to reduce the sale of shark fin soup and increase the number of marine reserves. Also, New York City has just banned the use of styrofoam cups. All of this is good work, but it is combatted when the Green Party are not allowed to take part in the British Election TV debtates. Even though I agree that the Green Party are small-ish and are unlikely to make massive in-roads within the political arena, they could still use the opportunity to highlight failings by other parties and also point out environmental issues that other parties AND the public may not have considered.", "id": "10152248588579229_10152253126869229", "user_likes": false}]}}
