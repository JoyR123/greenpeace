Fossil fuel companies already have so much coal and oil in their reserves that if they burn it all, it pretty much guarantees a worst-case scenario for humanity in terms of global warming.

The movement against Arctic drilling has become stronger than ever - we are now 6.8 million and growing. The six were just the tip of the iceberg that is the movement to Save the Arctic - it is you that Shell fears the most. It is people power.\n\nSo now that we have exposed Shell to the world, what shall we all do next? Join our online brainstorm - add your ideas, and 'like' the ones you think are worth developing.\n\nBe creative, be ambitious but keep it real, keep it non-violent and let's Save the Arctic!
