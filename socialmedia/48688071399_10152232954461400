Tomas forest reserve by none other than Baguio's one and only Dishonorable Tongressman Nicasio Aliping Jr. A trained lawyer and a supposed lawmaker on his first year as a legislator, who wilfully and arrogantly ignored the Environmental Laws of the country and covertly proceeded to cut and uproot hundreds of trees without the necessary permits, bulldozed the earth down the mountain side contaminating and polluting vital precious water sources just so he can build his private mountain resort! Now he continues to deny knowledge of it, blames everyone else but himself and takes no accountability nor responsibility despite the overwhelming evidence against him. The height of pure hypocrisy, blatant lies and arrogance! And no thanks to him others are trying to rebuild and recover the natural environment without any offers of assistance, funding or support from him.", "id": "10152232953986400_10152233686056400", "user_likes": false}]}}
