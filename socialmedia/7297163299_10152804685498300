On climate change.\n\u201cIt is my view that the vegetarian manner of living, by its purely physical effect on the human temperament, would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind.\u201d - said Albert Einstein \nAll we do in our lifetime is to scream in different ways to get attention about what is happening in the world, around us and under our noses. We are most often inspired and motivated by fairy tales, myths, and legends rather than logic. \nPeople often say that humans have always eaten animals, as if this is a justification for continuing the practice. By eating animals we share the responsibility of climate change, the destruction of our forests, and the poisoning of our air and water. By abstaining from eating animals, we reduce the demand and thus the killing. The simple act of becoming a vegan will make a difference in the health of our planet. If modern civilised man had to keep the animals he eats, the number of vegetarians would rise astronomically.\nHippos, elephants, rhinos, horses, bulls are among the strongest animals on the planet and they do not eat any meat or animal products, including milk (only in breastfeeding), dairy products or eggs. All their protein comes from plants.\nThis is for religious people and preachers: \nGenesis 1:29\nThen God said, \"Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every TREE, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; TO YOU IT SHALL BE FOR MEAT\u201d\n\u201cI cannot teach anybody anything. I can only make them think\u201d - Socrates\nhttps://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.752467488175702.1073741839.100002373744045&type=1\nConcentration of knowledge is one of the great evils of this planet.", "id": "10152804685053300_10152804687338300", "user_likes": false}]}}
