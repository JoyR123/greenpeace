Like many Australians, you think it\u2019s bound to be locally-caught flathead, or it\u2019s from somewhere in Australia at least. The reality is, there\u2019s a good chance that your fish has been shipped half-way around the world to get on your plate.  And because you don\u2019t know what type of fish it is or where it\u2019s from, it could be a threatened species, be from a destructive fishery that kills marine life like turtles, or even caught by slave labour. \n\nThe good news is that right now we have a chance to change the law in Australia that will mean you can go to the pub and know you\u2019re eating Aussie seafood. Our politicians are debating the law this week and you can help give them a nudge in the right direction. By making a quick call to your MP, or even dropping them an email, you could change fish labelling laws forever.", "total": {"new": 4.9052396878, "months": {"11": 35, "10": 56, "12": 353, "1": 67, "3": 64, "2": 57, "5": 54, "4": 54, "7": 41, "6": 42, "9": 35, "8": 39}, "reeng": {"10": 764, "1": 44, "3": 18, "2": 15, "5": 12, "4": 6, "7": 10, "6": 11, "9": 10, "8": 7}, "month": 7.469342252}, "type": "link", "id": "9480502970_10153803951002971", "description": "This week, Parliament, or at least the Senate, is due to debate a bill that would see the first step towards better labelling made into law."}
