He joins the long list of people - often black - who have been unjustly killed by the police both in the USA and UK.\n\nOver 50 people were arrested this week in Ferguson while protesting peacefully against the killing of Brown, as part of a Weekend of Resistance. Those arrested included members of the clergy, academics and activists.\n\nFind out more about Ferguson October, and the history of mobilising for social justice, below.", "total": {"new": 4.4585987261, "months": {"10": 54, "1": 49, "3": 28, "2": 47, "5": 30, "4": 22, "7": 25, "6": 20, "9": 19, "8": 20}, "reeng": {"10": 261, "1": 14, "3": 4, "2": 2, "5": 8, "4": 4, "7": 4, "6": 9, "9": 3, "8": 5}, "month": 15.6050955414}, "type": "link", "id": "9250349228_10152088215804229", "description": "Watch live here!
