Jewson says its timber is 'legal', because the loggers gave it some receipts...\n\nThe same loggers who fake documents all the time. \n\nIt's called \"timber laundering\". Sadly, it's so common in the Amazon that you can't rely on official-looking papers or trust the loggers who gave them to you. \n\nThis video explains how loggers loot the Amazon and get dodgy paperwork to cover their tracks. If Jewson watches it, then maybe it'll understand why it can't keep selling this suspect Amazon timber.\n\nWATCH and SHARE this video with #Jewson to help them understand the problem."}
