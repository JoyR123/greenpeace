Henk, and the Bluff based SV Tiama, now join Oil Free Otago to oppose deep sea drilling off the coast of Otago. \n\n\"Henk has defended our oceans for decades, so it's great to have someone with such a wealth of experience to support us, the people of Otago, in standing up to Anadarko,\"  said Oil Free Otago spokesperson Niamh O'Flynn.\n\nHaazen said, \"As a part of the Oil Free Seas flotilla that formed off Raglan in November to protest Anadarko\u2019s drilling in New Zealand waters and the dangers that this deep sea drilling brings to our oceans and coastlines, I am proud to show support for communities who are demanding a clean energy future.\"\n\nThe Noble Bob Douglas is at the end of their drilling program 110 nautical miles off the coast of Raglan, and their arrival in Otago waters is expected imminently.\nTheir drill  in the Canterbury Basin will be their second deep sea exploratory well to be drilled in New Zealand. Exploratory drilling is the riskiest stage of drilling and lead to the worst oceanic oil spill in history in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 for which Anadarko (as 25% owner of the Macondo Prospect) were found jointly and severally liable by US Courts.\nAnadarko have undertaken spill modelling based on striking condensate off Otago (not gas).\n\nOil Free Otago is inviting other boat boat owners to join in a peaceful protest flotilla. To join, please contact Niamh O'Flynn.\n\nSV Tiama will be docking at 8.00am tomorrow morning at 1 Birch Street, in Otago Harbour."}
