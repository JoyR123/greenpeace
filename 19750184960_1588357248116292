The Esperanza is the largest vessel in the Greenpeace fleet and has been on the frontline of activism since February 2002. The \u201cEspy\u201d, as we fondly call her, plays a key role in our campaigns, allowing us to bear witness and take action to prevent environmental crimes around the world.  \n\nCome and see us.  We'd love to meet you!  \n\nTake a tour of the ship on:\n\nSunday, May 3rd \n10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.\n\nIf you can\u2019t make it this Sunday, tours will also be available the following weekend:\n\nSaturday, May 9th \n10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.\n\nSunday, May 10th \n10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.\n\nRSVP for May 9/10 here: https://www.facebook.com/events/831789716901093/\n\nAccessibility:\n\nThe ship is docked at the end of a long pier 600 metres from the SeaBus terminal.\n\nParking near the pier is extremely limited.\n\nUnfortunately the ship is not very accessible.\n\nAnyone coming on board will need to walk up the single-file gangway and climb up and down steep stairways.\n\nShe\u2019s a working ship so practical shoes are best to wear."}
