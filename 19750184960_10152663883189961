And to those that will argue that \"oil is in everything\" and \"we need it\" go f$&k yourself!! It's this type of ignorance that gets me the most! This attitude is just what those oil pigs want you to have. Yes, my daily life involves use of oil and oil by-products, I'm an educated, well-informed person. I am also a middle class Canadian puppet of the corporate masterminds that have their hands in my pocket and often make it difficult to choose/support the alternatives.
