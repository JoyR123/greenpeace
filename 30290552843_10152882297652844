We repeat- comments abusing or showing intolerance towards festivals will be and have been deleted. Regarding questions about our funding sources- we are challenging all of MHA's allegations in the court and all documents are shared with relevant authorities. Donor information and details are sensitive as is known by everyone and will not be shared on public forums with anyone other than relevant authorities. Comments about Eid and other festivals- we are not a religious organisation. We campaign and lobby on environmental issues affecting our planet.
