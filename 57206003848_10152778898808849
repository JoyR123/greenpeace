Energy that won't use up and pollute our scarce water reserves. Energy that won't further contribute to our status as the 12th-largest carbon emitter in the world. Energy that will provide real, meaningful jobs for South African people.\n\nFracking for shale gas provides none of that. \n\nIf Shell was serious about securing South Africa's energy future, if that phrase was more than just a bunch of greenwashing, then Shell would cancel it's plans for fracking in South Africa. Instead Shell would plug into the incredible renewable energy opportunities that are up for grabs in places like the Karoo. Doing that would create far more jobs than fracking will -- and those jobs will be far more sustainable -- for the economy and the families relying on them.", "id": "10152778898808849_37096138", "user_likes": false}]}}
