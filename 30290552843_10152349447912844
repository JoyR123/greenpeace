We have read the entire statement and are aware of it. The reason for this post is to emphasize on the ambiguity of that statement and seeming denial of climate reality when he said that climate change hasn't happened. There is a glaring contradiction when the Prime Minister of the country says people affect the environment but his government goes on to dilute critical environmental laws that may pave the way for a worse scenario. You can read more about this here: bit.ly/1xCkm5H. In addition, the Prime Minister is reportedly also not attending the Climate Change Summit this month, which adds to the stand he is taking. While his words may say something, his actions are contradictory and show otherwise.", "id": "10152349447912844_10152349671927844", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2014, 9, 10, 6], "full_picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQDgjAoA-08rLUoj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fbsmedia.business-standard.com%2F_media%2Fbs%2Fimg%2Fcommon%2Fno_preview.jpg", "caption": "business-standard.com", "edge": "posts", "link": "http://bit.ly/1nKwSqc", "shares": {"count": 24}, "urls": [{"components": {"fragment": "", "netloc": "business-standard.com", "params": "", "query": {}, "path": ["article", "opinion", "india-cannot-afford-a-climate-change-skeptic-as-prime-minister-114091000128_1.html"], "scheme": "http"}, "url": "http://bit.ly/1nKwSqc", "driver": null, "ea": {"ea.campaign.id": null, "ea.client.id": null}, "redir": {"service": "bit.ly", "url": "http://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/india-cannot-afford-a-climate-change-skeptic-as-prime-minister-114091000128_1.html", "surl": "1nKwSqc", "key": "e0aab3559c712c9bbd213780b15b36f5", "aurora": false, "history": ["http://bit.ly/1nKwSqc"]}, "landing": "http://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/india-cannot-afford-a-climate-change-skeptic-as-prime-minister-114091000128_1.html", "key": "e0aab3559c712c9bbd213780b15b36f5", "petition": null}], "created_time": "2014-09-10T06:58:00+0000", "message": "India cannot afford a climate change skeptic as Prime Minister: http://bit.ly/1nKwSqc\n\nModi used to be a supporter for climate action. However, in public remark in the last week, he appears to have expressed doubt about whether climate change was even occurring.\n\nSince his election, Modi has dismantled a number of environmental protections, clearing the way for new coal mines and other industrial projects. His government is also pushing for dilution of environmental laws. Reportedly, he will be a no-show at the United Nations climate summit this month.\n\nEven if he acknowledges that people's habits are destroying the environment, his actions are contradictory and show otherwise.\nREAD: http://bit.ly/1nKwSqc", "total": {"new": 11.6279069767, "months": {"1": 14, "3": 15, "2": 14, "5": 8, "4": 5, "7": 3, "6": 4, "9": 18, "8": 5}, "reeng": {"10": 60, "1": 10, "3": 5, "5": 2, "4": 2, "7": 3, "8": 4}, "month": 16.2790697674}, "type": "link", "id": "30290552843_10152349447912844", "description": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a three part answer to a question on Teachers' Day about combating climate change.
