At least 138,500 dolphins and whales, they approximate, will be injured or possibly killed by the deafening blasts, including the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale.\"\n\nYep - we knew that - why doesn't the government care?!\n\nI can't imagine why the fishing industry isn't more up in arms about this too! I honestly think that Greenpeace New Zealand should campaign with the fishing industry and get them riled up - THEY can put pressure on the government here in a big way, and the government NEEDS more people to get angry about this. This report may be from overseas but it's a fact that fish stocks will be lost here in vast numbers because we're doing the same thing - and the industry will suffer along with the tourist industry. So even if people don't have enough empathy to care about the dolphins, whales, seals etc - surely they can care about their pockets when the fish die!\n\n\"Even fisheries are at risk. Airguns displace commercial species, kill fish eggs and larvae, and lower catch rates between 40 and 80 percent. Seismic blasts will impact the economies of seven Atlantic states, including more than 100 fishing communities and more than 500,000 marine tourism and local recreation jobs.\"", "id": "10152789152690775_10152796369790775", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2014, 10, 15, 19], "full_picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQBE9p0Kab9AmH53&url=http%3A%2F%2Fi.huffpost.com%2Fgen%2F1368389%2Fthumbs%2Fo-NORTH-ATLANTIC-RIGHT-WHALE-facebook.jpg", "caption": "huffingtonpost.com", "edge": "posts", "link": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sheryl-crow/whales-seismic-testing_b_3975608.html", "shares": {"count": 126}, "urls": [{"components": {"fragment": "", "netloc": "greenpeace.org", "params": "", "query": {}, "path": ["new-zealand", "en", "take-action", "Take-action-online", "Statoil_Northland"], "scheme": "http"}, "url": "http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/take-action/Take-action-online/Statoil_Northland", "driver": null, "ea": {"ea.campaign.id": null, "ea.client.id": null}, "redir": {"service": null, "url": "http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/take-action/Take-action-online/Statoil_Northland", "surl": null, "key": "e208bad673ebb5bcf863b573adcadd83", "aurora": false, "history": []}, "landing": "http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/take-action/Take-action-online/Statoil_Northland", "key": "e208bad673ebb5bcf863b573adcadd83", "petition": null}], "created_time": "2014-10-15T19:00:00+0000", "message": "America halts dangerous seismic testing on it's east coast.\n\nLet's stop it here in NZ too.\n\n#StopSeismicTesting #StopStatoil\n\nTake Action here : http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/take-action/Take-action-online/Statoil_Northland", "total": {"new": 2.8268551237, "months": {"10": 140, "1": 36, "3": 41, "2": 56, "5": 37, "4": 54, "7": 48, "6": 39, "9": 58, "8": 57}, "reeng": {"10": 481, "1": 16, "3": 13, "2": 8, "5": 5, "4": 8, "7": 12, "6": 12, "9": 7, "8": 4}, "month": 6.3604240283}, "type": "link", "id": "11870725774_10152789152690775", "description": "Imagine you are in the ocean.
