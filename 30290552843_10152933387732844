We thank you for your time and interest in giving us your feedback. While we will encourage Irshad to speak for himself (and yes, this blog was written by him!), please note that this show of solidarity was done by willing individuals who agreed with us about the clampdown we're facing. Nobody (including children) were forced to do this, and that is certainly not our intent. Every individual may protect the environment in their chosen way, but this collective gathering was to show our togetherness for our environment and democracy. We certainly are not belittling our democracy. We're as proud of it as anyone can be, and we're concerned that the wonderful democratic values of our country are being threatened.", "id": "10152933387732844_10152933770237844", "user_likes": false}]}, "datetime": [2015, 6, 12, 9], "full_picture": "https://fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net/safe_image.php?d=AQC3HdpkqUfSmUQX&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenpeace.org%2Findia%2FReSizes%2FLarge%2FGlobal%2Findia%2F2015%2FBlogs%2Firshadblog.jpg", "caption": "greenpeace.org", "edge": "posts", "link": "http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Blog/Community_blogs1/am-i-doing-the-right-thing/blog/53200/", "shares": {"count": 30}, "urls": [], "created_time": "2015-06-12T09:30:00+0000", "message": "We love this story of how an engineer in the making found his calling in working for the environment!
