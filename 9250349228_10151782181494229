Which tree has saved millions of lives?\n\nFor about the last 100,000 years, malaria has been one of the deadliest diseases on the planet. For a long time there was almost nothing anyone could do until the discovery of the cinchona tree.\n\nThe bark of this incredible tree contains quinine which treats malaria, reduces fever and swelling and is a pain killer. It was discovered by the Quechua people of the Andes in South America but wasn\u2019t brought to Europe until a Jesuit missionary and apothecary discovered its anti-malarial properties.\n\nSince then countless lives have been saved by the use of quinine. Though it has been superseded by modern medicines, the World Health Organisation still counts it as an Essential Medicine which should be kept by all health services.\n\nIf we keep cutting down the rainforests we may never discover the next incredible medicine tree. Every year new species of trees and plants are discovered with medicinal properties. Just one more reason to protect the rainforests.
