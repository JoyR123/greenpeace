A few minutes ago I wrote this on a nostalgic meme for 79\u00a2 gas prices: What kills me is that people think prices will come down at any point. I have to break it to you. Oil futures will only raise because it is becoming harder to get oil to the refineries before it's dumped in the ocean or leaked into the soil. A finite resource it will only ever get more scarce and the price will continue to go up so current investors can make their money and until the last loser buys the final shares of the final barrels to supply... nascar. Get out now, invest in alternatives. With the speed of hybrid vehicles being what it is I think ponies might be the ticket.
